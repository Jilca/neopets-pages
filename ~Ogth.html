<h1>➜ Prologue</h1>
<p><i>There's a certain elegance that can be found in...destruction.</i>

</p><ul><li>The vinyl player spun a twisted, backwards tune of the distorted voice of someone who, just as twisted in his mind, led a better life filled only a fraction of the room. It lifted my better sense and revived the part of my mind medicine sought—and failed—to bury. A wisp of a thought weaved through, activating old emotions and memories. I was an abandoned clock, my web-laden cogs and rust-encrusted hands delicately discovering movement again. The hands that tick to the beat of time reflect my own drumming heart, enlivened by passion, adrenaline, and thirst.

<p>Throughout my years, the most glorious ones, I encountered many boundlessly talented and potent artists, all with their own morbid brand of beauty. It appeared that we all shared some traits traced back to insanity. Traits that, during our time at the asylum, proved vital to make us a family. When the rest of the world condemned us to distasteful titles, the only way for people like us to "recover" was to find a brand of psychosis so alien to society it stretches beyond their puny spectrum of understanding. Our best instinct was resourcefulness. We used to paint, sculpt, and sketch on nearly anything when our brushes and clays were stowed away.  

</p><p>Esther was rumored for his chocolate sculptures crafted from feces. Marie excelled in stranding loose hairs into bracelets. Me, well...I bid my ideas for the rare times doctors deemed me "calm" enough to "scribble" on non-toxic crayons and dollar store notebooks. I only created masterpieces, unlike those pitiful excuses for artists who settled for common discards.

</p><p>I drew flowers. At least, they appeared to be roses and poppies to the unartful eye. They were in fact human limbs distorted so crudely, assembled in such artful abstraction, they no long resembled flesh.
</p><p>Thirteen years after my release, I stood alone in a cottage hermit to society accompanied by the occasional lost hiker and garbage-hunting raccoon. I stood in the midst of the flesh flowers that finally assumed life from mere manifestation. I sheathed my red-inked pen in a cap that slid over its long tip, gripped by a leather handle. I sharpened it regularly so that it was sharp enough to cut air itself, soothed to slumber by the sweet sound of metal against metal. It was the most unique pen of its kind, crafted by the most brilliant blacksmith in the asylum. Needless to say he was thanked in the <i>most</i> fitting way possible: with the pen plunged four inches into his stomach so that he could spend his last moments basking in the glory of his greatest masterpiece.
</p><p>After all, what masterpiece can this be if another living soul has the ability to trump it? Every craftsman I have come across has been graced with the tip of my pen, diminishing the need for ink as it is expunged from the bodies of these very canvases. And oh how very convenient and cost-efficient they are! They come in varying sizes and shapes and textures. It is as if I had the entire world at my disposal. It is as if the universe itself bid me to create works so magnificent unholy entities have no place laying their eyes on it…unless it is literal of course.
</p><p>I cast a long look around the room, the atmosphere glooming as my vision tinged with the sorrowful gaze of departure. Better a masterpiece unseen than seen by the undeserving eyes.

<h1>➜ Chapter One</h1>
<ul><li>I met her on the thirteenth day my insanity began to worsen. I remembered that day precisely down to the soft light of predawn protruding through the window and my morning tea brewing on the kitchen counter, nearly at its ideal temperature of ninety-four degrees Celsius.
<p>I had just completed my daily flower sketch. It lay enmeshed with the twelve other crudely-drawn lilies and tulips and orchids. They always reminded me of my better days, those days when I was merely an overly-expressive artist forced to draw flowers to stop from being viewed as a psychotic wreck. As someone who was constantly pursued by cruel irony I was now a psychotic wreck forced to draw flowers to appear as an expressive artist.
</p><p>My hands began to shake the moment I laid eyes on her. They usually only did in adrenaline of a new project, a new experiment. Beneath the grey cloak soaked in the rain I made out full, red lips and high cheekbones. Her ivory black hair was concealed in a tight bun and loose wisps of it hung over harsh azure eyes. Though she was short her body was thrown back and she stood erect like a fierce lioness. My hands knew exactly how to mold this proud beast, but little did I know the kitty had claws.
</p><p>."How may I help you?" I asked smoothly, easing into my mountain tour guide tone. I hoped the tinge of lust in my voice was played off as casualness. "Directions? Food? A place to stay?"
</p><p>Her bottom lip quivered ever so slightly, from the cold I presumed. Someone who was not studying her features so intently would not have noticed such a movement. "Something warm to drink would be lovely," she said. I couldn't help the frown distorting my face. Her voice was rather coarse, a sound such a dainty little lady should not be able to produce. She noticed the change in my expression and offered quietly, "I haven't had any water for days."
</p><p>I stepped aside to allow her entry. <i>Good thing art is for the eyes and not for the ears</i> I mused. "Washroom is just down the hall and dining room is to the left." Her gratitude came in the form of a court nod as she slid past. Something that resembled a tail flashed from the fringe of her cloak and vanished.

</p><p><b>History:</b> She who was once an untameable beast became nothing more than a harmless girl with the touch of a harmless light that became a lethal weapon.
</p><p>She had stumbled across it during one of her last raids; its existence veiled in a sacred temple only the holiest of priests and priestesses were granted access to. She had pilfered it, ignoring their warnings of the unworldly dark magic it possesses. It weighs the wrongdoings of an individual and dims and heavies based on that. If she were to abandon this artifact without fully amending for her mistakes, her life will become the source of magic for this treacherous weapon until it is sucked completely dry.</p>
