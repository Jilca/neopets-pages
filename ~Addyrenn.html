Reborn. New life. Fire rising into a vibrant birth.<p>



Have you ever burned before?</p><p>



It is not easy. It sears, clawing at you with a thousand poisoned fangs that you cannot pry away, clenching your throat closed with its fingers and collapsing your lungs with smoke.</p><p>



To burn is a punishment. It is the consequence for failure in a field where failure cannot be tolerated. We are born again only to right our crimes with endless servitude.</p><p>



I have burned half a dozen times. The pain never lessens.</p><p>



This will be my seventh, and my last. For starting today, I will burn forever.

We burn when we fail; and in a domain so collapsed where success is no longer viable, my Guardianship is deemed broken and I the one who brought it to its death. For the death of my domain, I accept my Final Death.<p>



There have been five Interworld Wars, and I have burned for each of them. For this past Interworld War, professed to be the worst of its siblings, I have burned twice. I have been tasked to guard the portals, and in this I have failed immeasurably.</p><p>



Now I have closed all portals, reversed their paths, turning windows into mirrors. By doing so I have transformed the Interworld War into a series of Intraworld Wars, cutting off displaced denizens from returning to their home world, and leaving the universe in imbalance. This instability will result in decay and, ultimately, the death of the universe, and I will be the first to burn.</p><p>



I have failed my domain; I have failed myself; and I have failed the Guardians. For this, may the flames end my Guardianship and may its light cast new hope.

<i>In the hush that descends across the spectators - of which you are a part - your throat constricts with half-formed thoughts and your mind is weighted with sporadic words. It is inappropriate to speak now, with the confession already spoken and the phoenix now ascending the steps to her pyre, but you cannot deny that there is a strong urge within you to talk, act out - something, anything to hinder the burning.</i><br><br><center>

The flames are beautiful when Addyrenn steps in.<br><br>



They don't burn orange, or red, or yellow - not even blue. They burn in violets and tangerines and crimsons, more vibrant than anything you've ever seen.<br><br>



They dance alive, and you wonder how something so beautiful could hurt at all.
