    <h2>A Little About Rittze</h2>
    
    <p>Energetic, free-spirited and kind, Rittze grew up on the tropical island of Laisne - a great distance from his current residence in the city of Undertown. The second eldest child in a rather large family, he left his home in order to find his place in the world. Eager for new opportunities, internal growth, and his own meaning to life, Rittze felt he was destined for far better things than idling his days away on Laisne. Following a chance encounter with one of his island's temple spirits, the young man would leave the comfort of his island in search of his own destiny - armed with no more than a strong sense of adventure and a will to carve his very own path.<br><br><img title="May I take your order?" src="http://i.imgur.com/HcsrZDA.png" style="padding: 20px 20px 30px; width: 240px; margin-top: -30px; float: left; margin-left: -130px;"> Although many regard Undertown as a polluted, underdeveloped and dangerous place, Rittze has long fallen in love with the urban jungle for all its imperfections. Taking to shredding sidewalks and industrial areas with ease, Rittze is hardly deterred by the city's high crime rate and has adapted well to his surroundings - finding enjoyment in making an honest living on his day job at the Café, alongside his co-worker and confidante, Qhuo. <br><br>
    
    That isn't to say, however, that Rittze's journey was straight-forward and un-riddled with its own complications; or that he didn't make a great number of mistakes along the way. But where others would dwell on past errors, Rittze has chosen to make peace with his choices and remains confident that without them, he would not be the individual he is today.</p>
    
    <center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hpHCVIe.png"></center><br></div>
    </div>
    
    
    <div id="appearance">
    
    <div style="width: 1000px; overflow: visible;" class="contentxl">
    
    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    
    <div style="position: absolute;" class="look"><p>Rittze is an exceptionally athletic teenager with a commanding, yet playful, presence and casually sporty style. While he's far from the tallest among his peers, standing at a comfortable 5'7", he's easily one of the fittest. With a well-toned build and shapely calves, Rittze's figure is only emphasized more thanks to the bright splashes of color and prints he's almost always spotted wearing.<br><br>
    
    Rittze often prefers to keep to loose, urban clothing and sneakers as it allows for easy movement for activities like parkour or skateboarding. Of course, while at work, the tables are a bit turned and Rittze has grown accustomed to presenting himself in the much more gentlemanly style of a well tailored waiter's uniform. The only other occasion which would see Rittze formally attired is when the Goon Squad has official business to handle; in which case dark suits are often the common, and only, choice. <br><br>
    
    Rittze has inherent heterochromia which frequently invites stares from strangers (after all, those eyes aren't called his selling point for nothing). The right eye is a bright ruby red while the left is a glittering emerald green; and while mutants and demons may come in all shapes, sizes and colours, some features such as this are still regarded as unusual or uncommon.</p>
    
    <center><img src="http://orig14.deviantart.net/3ee4/f/2016/148/6/e/divider_by_kawaiicurls-da42zs2.png" style="width: 140px; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></center>
    
    <p>Pronouncing the young man's beautiful eyes even more, a splash of crimson on his tangerine skin forms a partial mask to the left side of his oval face. The red patches extend from his face, down to his neck and shoulders. It resumes, hugging around his lower back, hip and thigh to the base of his tail and appears again around his left ankle and foot.  No more than a natural occurring amalgamation of his parents genetics, his unusual skin  and eyes are merely cosmetic in their nature and don't affect him in any particular way - aside from suggesting he shouldn't wear clothes with cold undertones (and even then, he would do it anyway!). <br><br> 
    
    His violet red hair is often pulled back into a high, bushy pony tail, and is streaked with natural saffron highlights. His horns are tough and slim, slung low and curved back over his head. Rittze also possesses dusky red-ochre hand-tapped tattoos, extending from his upper right arm and neck to his left. These tattoos are a rite of adulthood for young men within the culture of his birthplace, and a symbol of protection.
    </p></div>
    
    <img style="position: relative; margin-left: -260px;" src="http://orig15.deviantart.net/0274/f/2016/147/c/a/appearance04_by_kawaiicurls-da41pv1.png"></div></div>
    
    <br><br><br><div id="manner">
    
    <div class="contentsm">
    <h2>Mannerism</h2>
    
    
    
    <p>Rittze has remarkable coordination and an enviable sense of balance. His quick reflexes have often averted anywhere from small disasters such as: catching plates hurled by rabble rousing customers, to much larger disasters like: pulling a team mate out of the path of a stray bullet on a mission.<br><br>
    
    While Rittze may not always know what he's doing, he often carries himself with confidence and makes valiant attempts to try things that are new. Though he's (usually) sporting enough to admit that he can't succeed at everything he tries, he has enough of a competitive spirit to want to improve – especially if he feels he's gained a rival. That said, Rittze isn't above taunting others for their failures or shortcomings, but reserves it for close acquaintances and established rivals. More often than not, his comments are made in jest. </p>
      
    <center><img style="margin-top: -20px; margin-left: -100px; width: 900px;" src="http://orig04.deviantart.net/babd/f/2016/146/2/d/accounts_surfboard04_by_kawaiicurls-da3ukj6.png" title="Although he can manipulate air, he's just as happy in the water."></center>  
    
    <p>Rittze has an exceedingly approachable personality: he's the type to laugh at a stranger's well-humoured joke and subsequently offer a smile. His warm nature often puts others at ease; though conversely, there are those who have a low tolerance for his seemingly perpetual good mood and relaxed state of being (to which, he pays no heed). <br><br>
    
    Much like the air that whips around him, Rittze has a tendency to speak fast and gesture with his hands - occasionally engaging in an arbitrary game of charades when he can't find the right words to describe a situation. Far more of a kinesthetic learner, Rittze's attention span for listening tends to fall short and he finds it difficult to sit still for any great length of time. <br><br>
    
    While Rittze is still a boisterous youth, his journey has helped him to grow and he's steadily maturing under the guidance of those older and wiser, particularly within the Goon Squad.

    <span style="text-align: center;"><p>Rittze's family have also had quite an impact on his character, and so I've included a little bit about them as I believe knowing about a person's family helps shape an understanding of their principles and attitude. Although none of Rittze's family features in the ongoing RP, I keep their characters in mind and muse to the possibility of having them encountering the Goon Squad in a possible future arc.</p></span>

    <br><br><p>When Rhythk Paizen, a powerful elemental demon, met Juna, a graceful and humble woman of mutant origins, it was love at first sight. Well, at least it was for him!<br><br>
    
    Persuaded neither by the demon's endearing character nor by his good looks, Juna saw Rhythk as no more than a charmingly reckless idiot with one too many hedonistic tendencies. Having dedicated the entirety of her own life to helping others, she served as a Healer in the dangerous, fiery city of Ragul in the Demon Realm. <br><br><img style="float: left; margin-top: -10px; width: 160px; margin-left: -10px; padding-right: 10px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/JDlP4eQ.png" title="Laisne"> Still, Rhythk's persistence and unexpectedly genuine nature set him apart from suitors that had come before; and in time, Juna found herself struggling to accept the thought of a reality which did not include the man who had grown in time to become her best and truest friend, if not the love of her life. She was eventually persuaded to leave Ragul for Rhythk's home in the mortal world on the island of Laisne - a tropical paradise of otherworldly beauty.<br><br> There, she continues to act as a healer to the indigenous community – Rhythk's people and a small but proud clan of elemental demons. Rhythk on the other hand, continues to remain somewhat of a mystery – neglecting to discuss his activities beyond the time he spends as a teacher, often guiding young demons and mutants as they gain better control of their elemental abilities.</p>

    <p>Both Rhythk and Juna are wonderful parents to their eight children, even if Juna has to assume a gentle but authoritative role over her husband's relentless encouragement of his children's hazardous curiosities. <br><br>
    
    Rittze enjoys a loving relationship with his mother, and although his father never misses the opportunity to tease his foolhardy son, Rhythk has also nurtured Rittze's adventurous spirit and self-confidence. Rittze has certainly inherited his father's persistence, and is often relentless in the pursuit of anything he's set his mind to.<br><br>
    
    Being the only boy and second eldest in his colourful family, Rittze's younger sisters adore him, although they also recognize that their darling big brother is at essence, somewhat of a reckless goof. His elder sister, Petra, tends to be the strongest voice of reason in the Paizen household – and is the paragon of responsibility. Although she once lamented that her younger brother needed to become more responsible and was supportive of the idea of him leaving, she secretly misses him the most – even if her affectionate greeting at meeting him again would likely be expressed with a loving, but bruising, punch to the arm.

    <h2>Abilities</h2>
      
    <blockquote>
    
    <h3>Mutant &amp; Demon Physiology</h3><img style="float: left; margin-left: -80px; width: 150px; margin-top: 0px; padding: 10px 10px 60px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/C4mH9wN.png"><p>Rittze possesses the inherent abilities of a mutant: great physical strength and durability. He also holds a certain amount of strength as a half-demon, and though weaker than full-blood counterparts, Rittze has prolonged youth and an accelerated healing rate, though he isn't immune from requiring medical attention in the case of serious injuries like broken bones or firearm-induced wounds.   <br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZF9Pnoe.png" style="float: right; padding: 10px; margin-top: -10px; margin-right: -80px; width: 140px;">In addition to that, his prehensile tail helps him maintain balance even if it brings with it the awkward occasion of tripping others up by accident (or much to his annoyance, having it stepped on). His horns are comparatively slimmer than that of most demons and formed of bone. They protrude forward from his forehead slightly and are slung back over the top of his head, acting as a natural helmet of sorts.</p></blockquote>
    
      <blockquote><h3>Air Manipulation</h3><p> Rittze's ability to control the air around him comes as naturally as breathing. It often manifests around him in various emotionally charged states, ruffling his hair and clothes lightly when not in active use. He can conjure a breeze light enough to stir fallen leaves to dance, and when unhinged, create gales strong enough to uproot trees, though the latter requires concentration and is likelier to result in a temporary re-percussive coma.  <br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xvHLjru.png" style="float: left; width: 190px; padding: 10px; margin-top: -30px; margin-left: -60px;">
    Rittze is unable to cause tornadoes or change the weather (much to his chagrin), nor can he manipulate moving objects as finely as a telekinetic would. Were you expecting Rittze to <i>blow</i> a cup of coffee across a counter to you, you would end up with a soaked lap and one very apologetic waiter.<br><br>
    
     While Rittze is wingless and can't 'fly', it doesn't stop him from enjoying free falling - as he is able to catch himself from fatalities by cushioning his landing with air. In terms of using his power for offense, Rittze has a high tendency to throw his opponents off balance; however, he is also able to create air blades which slash enemies from a moderate distance. Although this is far less exhaustive than other applications of his ability, it is also seldom employed given the often violent outcome of such confrontations. In essence, Rittze's ability to control air is limited only by his imagination and unwillingness to needlessly harm another living being.</p>

     </blockquote>
      <blockquote><h3>Resistance to Fire</h3><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mxIyD0L.png" style="padding: 10px; float: right; width: 180px; margin-top: -30px; margin-right: -110px;"><p>An extension of Rittze's mutant genetics, he possesses a natural resistance to heat and flames. With skin able to endure extremely high temperatures, it is for this reason that Rittze comes to work on the same team as Qhuo while in the Goon Squad. Combining their air elemental and fire elemental abilities, both Rittze and Qhuo form a deadly duo - capable of creating and rapidly spreading walls of fire to impede enemy movements, or creating diversions and destroying evidence.</p></blockquote>
      <blockquote><h3>Flexibility</h3><img style="width: 150px; padding: 10px; float: left; margin-top: -50px; margin-left: -70px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/OUN9eg8.png"><p>Nurtured from a young age through Rittze's active lifestyle and hobbies, he possesses impressive natural flexibility that lends itself to physical combat, far less injury and an increased range of motion.<br><br>It also typically ensures easy wins in games of Twister.</p></blockquote>

    <h2>Relationships</h2><br><blockquote>
    <h3>Qhuo, His Best Friend</h3><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/AvERtZJ.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; padding: 5px; margin-left: -20px; margin-top: -110px;" class="y"><a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Qhuote">Qhuo</a> is an upbeat young man who shares many of the same viewpoints, and jobs, as Rittze. Confident, outgoing, calm and lovable, Qhuo was one of the first people in Undertown to truly extend a sincere and welcoming hand to Rittze, and has since then become his closest friend. Rittze appreciates his agreeable personality and has grown to accept that any advice and criticism Qhuo may offer always comes from a place of genuine care and concern.<br><br>
    
    Qhuo was also one of the first to vouch for Rittze's character to Uhnka, and the Goon Squad's more senior members - having decided that Rittze's principles aligned well with his own and that he would make for a powerful ally. These days, although they may often be found together working side by side as waiters in the Golden Lotus Café, their camaraderie extends far beyond those walls and onto the same team within GS. Together, their complementary powers of wind and fire make for a dangerous duo and a raging force few would want to reckon with.
    <br><br></p> 
    
    <center><p><i><span style="color: #c2c200;">Rittze, buddy, I know you're excited and all to be working with the group now – but, phew, calm down a bit. I really don't want you walking in here and accidentally knocking over one of Uhnka's expensive vases or something with your powers. You thought Aleire was bad when he's angry? Hah, you, my friend, have got a lot of learning to do – welcome aboard.</span></i></p></center>
    
    </blockquote><br><br><blockquote><h3>Fuu, His Partner-In-Crime</h3> <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DqnHPpr.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; padding: 5px; margin-right: -18px; margin-top: -110px;" class="y"><a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Fuudogged">Fuu</a> is quite the oddball in the eyes of outsiders - but to the Goon Squad, this misunderstood kiddo serves as a strong reminder that you really can't judge a book by its cover. A powerful fighter with a disturbing past, Fuu's experiences have deeply affected him and left the youth with a tendency to function in ways most would consider feral or untamed. Yet, Fuu is a warm and affectionate soul, and expresses it plainly through his strong desire to protect his comrades - just one of many qualities that Rittze relates to and respects full-heartedly.<br><br>
    
    In the early days, before Rittze joined GS and when Fuu was a less frequent customer of the Café, they came to develop a peculiar friendship.
    While Rittze's delight at catching glimpses of this quiet boy was prominent to others, Fuu's interactions with Rittze were little more than somewhat muted. However, things began to change, and as Fuu and Rittze continued to interact, Fuu found himself branching out of his comfort zone - seeking out Rittze of his own accord, and striking up conversations on his own with an amount of enthusiasm rarely exhibited before.<br><br></p>
    
    <center><p><i><span style="color: #c2c200;">...Go out?...Where?</span></i></p></center>
    
    </blockquote><br><br><blockquote><h3>Uhnka, His Boss</h3> <p><img class="y" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; padding: 5px; margin-left: -20px; margin-top: -110px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/BFD5MQH.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bCSDEgV.png" style="margin-top: 10px; float: right; width: 120px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: -10px;"><a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Uhnka">Uhnka</a> is the head of the Goon Squad and a man you wouldn't want to mess with. Powerful yet calm, and collected, he works primarily from his desk - giving orders and keeping the streets of Undertown under as much control as the city's troublesome landscape and citizens will allow. Between tackling law enforcement, corrupt politicians, bounties and rivalling gangs, it's a rather hard job, but it's definitely one Uhnka is deeply invested in.<br><br> 
    On Qhuo and Zhram's recommendation, Uhnka makes the decision to offer Rittze stable employment within his organization. Leading his group with a firm hand and a sense of experience that many members, including Rittze, deeply respect, Uhnka's often stoic façade originally intimidated their newest member. But while Uhnka may give off the air of an unapproachable employer, Rittze would eventually learn that beneath that mask lies a much more eccentric personality - one well worth teasing... Even if the consequences can be, well, regrettable.<br><br></p>
    
    <center><p><i><span style="color: #c2c200;">I swear to Kabhu, Rittze, if you don't get your act together I'm going to toss you ou– Excuse me, this isn't a joke. I'm serious here... Hello? Is anyone even listening to me anymore?<br>
    ....That's it! This is the <i>last time</i> I'm recruiting a teenager into the group.
    </span></i></p></center>
    </blockquote> <br><br><blockquote><h3>Aleire, His Mistake</h3> <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZTfy8EB.png" style="float: right; padding: 5px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: -18px; margin-top: -110px;" class="y"><a href="/~Haootia">Aleire</a> and Rittze first met a little over a year before Rittze would find his way into the Goon Squad. Back when Rittze had first arrived in Undertown as an outgoing and highly naïve teenager, he was fast met with hardship in trying to find a means of supporting himself and staying afloat in the tough town. Having few marketable skiIIs aside from his swift sporty tricks, a point of desperation (or returning home) seemed imminent. As he began to toe on that very line, feeling frustrated and limited by his options, he aimlessly rolled into a part of the city which belonged to a group known as the Punk Pantherz.<br><br><img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px; width: 140px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/jZWfJzM.png">
    Unbeknownst to Ritt, Aleire - the eventual leader of the group - had been observing him that day, taking measure of his abilities and recognizing his talent. It wasn't long after that their paths crossed again, and altogether Rittze was besotted by Aleire's own speed and capabilities which matched if not exceeded his own. After an impromptu race, which Aleire won quite confidently, the young man extended an offer to Rittze - join their group and earn a living as a thief. Conflicted, Rittze was hesitant at first but the light hearted company that comprised Punk Pantherz tight-knit group soon allayed his better judgement – and so he came under Aleire's care, caught up in the spell of being surrounded by a spirited bunch he could relate to.<br><br>
    
    Rittze has since returned to his better senses, acknowledging that the life of a thief was certainly not meant to be the crux of his destiny. He departed the Pantherz which outwardly broke any relations to Aleire - though he still views him with awe and admiration. Similarly, as betrayed as Aleire felt, he knows that if Rittze ever called on him for help, he would answer it out of respect for the happier times they shared together – though this truth remains a personal secret.
    
    <br><br></p>
    
    
    <center><p><i><span style="color: #c2c200;">With you, I can never tell if your idealism is the result of genuine naivety or unbelievable arrogance. 
    Just don't get so caught up in believing your destiny is to change the world when all you've done is sacrifice working with thieves to work with murderers instead. But if you're ever ready to tell me just what it is about this group that has you so readily convinced they're capable of it… I'm literally all ears.

    <p>	<b class="ritt">I've always liked the view from up here,</b> a silvery voice rang out – the speaker a young man whose form was adorned by loose fitting clothes and a pleasantly upturned smile upon his oval face. His eyes peered out over a valley as he dangled long, well-toned legs and bare feet over the edge of a wide cliff. Far beneath him, he watched as people emerged from their homes, toting with them large baskets full of endless delights. From fruit to trinkets, to weaponry and fine fabrics, the young man watched as the village below him buzzed in joyful banter as the Festival of Odo'Embre drew closer.<br><br>
        At the edge of the village, a large bonfire burned, sending smokestacks upwards and into the clouds – bending and twisting to the air's whims like dancers entwined in an endless waltz. The young man watched quietly from his perch, tapping lightly on the ground as music began to emanate from around the burning flames. Above him, the dusky sky appeared dappled in shades of oranges and purples as the sun settled in for its nightly rest behind their Island's central volcano which was seen as a sacred home to the deity this festival was meant to praise. <br><br>
        Another cool breeze brushed past his shoulders then and he turned his attention away from the village and out past the ocean which protected it. Far away in the distance, he fooled himself into making out the silhouette of another city - one which he'd only heard about from the hushed chatter of a few villagers. <br><br>
        How he wanted to go there: to see the outside world and learn – how he ached to see what those concrete jungles were truly like, and partake in new encounters. No, it was much more than that – he wanted to find his own destiny, and he knew it was not here. This is what was nagging at his thoughts. <br><br><b class="petra">Rittze!</b> <br><br>
        A voice sounded out much louder than his innermost thoughts, forcing the young man's attention once more down to his village. His heterochromatic eyes took in the colourful scenes beneath his plateau again, but this time they were dominated by the prominent figure of a clearly agitated woman. <br><br><b class="petra">What are you doing up there?</b> The voice thundered once more, audible as the wind around his ears carried her tone quite clearly. It was commanding, yet tinged with affection that only a doting family member could give. <br><br><b class="ritt">Praying,</b> the young man shrugged playfully as he offered a cheeky grin. His voice was soft, but he knew the breeze would carry it down towards the woman just as hers had been carried to him. Sure enough, he watched as her ex-pression changed from one of annoyance to playful mimicry. <br><br><b class="petra">Praying? You?</b> She chortled, <b class="petra">don't make me laugh, dear brother. The chances of you doing such things are about as much as the Island not being covered in a sickeningly sweet haze when the Toppoa fruits are in season.</b> <br><br><b class="ritt">Still not used to it, Petra?</b> Rittze asked his sister, waiting as the wind carried his voice down to her crimson ears before she folded her arms in response. <br><br><b class="petra">Enough of this, brother,</b> she sighed, <b class="petra">I have work to do before everything begins. Please, get yourself together and, for goodness sakes, whatever your offerings are, bring them to the fire before the rest of the village finds out you're slacking off again.</b> She ran a hand through her dark, red hair, and eyed her brother with concern before turning on her heel and disappearing behind the thatched roof of a large hut. <br><br>
        Leaning back, Rittze closed his eyes once more – taking in another deep breath of that oh-so-sweet scent his sister was so averse to. Long, violet tresses were ruffled against his tangerine skin while a chipper melody crept out of well-shaped lips. He whistled an upbeat tune that danced in unison to the air around him; his hypnotic eyes calmly focused on the orange-washed sky before him. <br><br>
        He knew he should listen to her words. That he should find his own offerings before the festivities began and join his family, friends, and fellow kinsmen among the warm embrace of the bonfire's radiance. After all, this was and would forever be his home - the least he could do was adhere to traditions. <br><br></p>
    <center><img style="width: 140px; margin-bottom: 5px;" src="http://orig14.deviantart.net/3ee4/f/2016/148/6/e/divider_by_kawaiicurls-da42zs2.png"></center>
        <p>The sun had now set completely and Rittze had just narrowly managed sneaking away from the raucous jubilation. He'd grown accustomed to it by now; but, there was always a lingering feeling of emptiness that pervaded his thoughts as others enjoyed the festivities. In his hands he carried the offerings he was to give their deity - the Toppoa fruit of their island he had gathered on his own and crushed into a poultice used to help heal ones spiritual wounds. It was a simple gift really, he knew this, but he had also heard stories from the elders that their deity's favorite food was the Toppoa itself. <br><br>
        Quietly he walked through the dense underbrush of his home as he clung tightly to his woven satchel - barely managing to see the road beneath his bare feet while his toes sank pleasantly into the cool, damp soil. Around him, the chirps and chatters of all manners of beasts was a welcoming sound which aided in clearing his mind, and he heaved a sigh of relief when the trees before him broke way into a large, barren clearing. It was the passageway into the depths of Odo'Embre, into what was presumed to be the throne of their deity's Island.<br><br>
        Straightening up, Rittze tightened his satchel and slung it gently over his shoulders so that it could rest against his broad back. He would need his hands free while venturing into the volcano itself; after all, he had waited until it was far too late to bring his gift to its resting place. Still though, he was adamant in doing so. Approaching the entrance, Rittze placed his long fingers into the darkness, feeling along the rocky wall for a torch that rested quite snug in its holdings. <br><br>
        It was unlit and wrapped in brand new rags soaked in oils that would keep the flames lit for nights on end, and the young man was careful in checking its condition along the base of the torch, assuring no breakage would happen. He couldn't afford to lose his only source of light. Turning his head down the passageway, he spotted the smoldering remains of another torch; and, lifting one hand upwards, he motioned towards it. <br><br>
        The rags stirred to life once more as a gentle breeze coaxed forth a few remaining embers. With a quick flick of Rittze's wrist, dusty flames were blown towards his direction and onto the torch he held outstretched before him. Holding the torch up above his head, he began down the path further into Odo'Embre – far from minding the growing heat that rose up from its depths. <br><br></p>
    <center><img style="width: 140px; margin-bottom: 5px;" src="http://orig14.deviantart.net/3ee4/f/2016/148/6/e/divider_by_kawaiicurls-da42zs2.png"></center>
        <p><b class="ritt">Wow,</b> the word escaped Rittze in a soft breath as he rounded the final corner of Odo'Embre's path into its innermost chamber. Contained within these walls were piles of gifts, each lovingly wrapped in satchels or basket not quite unlike his own. At the base of a giant, heat-fractured serpentine statue, a large basket was splayed out with a feast of different foods native to his home. <b class="ritt">Think you've got enough there?</b> The young man joked, placing his torch to the side, on another holder, and reaching over his back to unfasten his own gift. <br><br>
        Stepping forward, he withdrew the bottle full and double checked that the cap was well sealed before gently placing it at the foot of the statue. He looked up from beneath the massive, stone structure's chin then – boredly poking at the other gifts that had been left. <b class="ritt">Must be nice</b> he started, looking the statue straight in its eyes. <b class="ritt">But I wonder if you're content being stuck like this?</b> He tapped on the detailed engraving of scales with his knuckles before smiling once more, <b class="ritt">tell me, oh mighty deity, what's it like being <i>stuck somewhere</i> when it feels like you're meant for so much more?</b> <br><br>
        There was no reply. <br><br><b class="ritt">Of course,</b> Rittze sighed, sitting down on the ground as he rubbed his forehead, <b class="ritt">I'm talking to statues now...</b> Even without an answer, he didn't feel like departing the sanctum – not when it meant returning to the remains of a festival and his family still swept up in the afterglow of its revelries, when his mind was so detached. Instead, he laid his head down – indulging in the warmth of the ground against his back. He heaved a much heartier sigh this time, taking in the heat of his surroundings as the hot air filled his lungs. <br><br>
        Again, a tuneful melody escaped his pursed lips, and it was the same ditty he'd whistled many hours before it jumped back into the forefront of his mind; but, it didn't last for long as Rittze's eyes began to close – the warmth against his body lulling him to sleep. <br><br><i>Peace. Quiet.</i><br><br>
    It was a world he was so accustomed to, and his mind wandered again to the lands far beyond the seas he'd spent so many hours in. What was it like there? How far did skyscraypers truly touch the sky, and what of the people who lived there? Were they like him? Were they tall? Or more beastly, perhaps? He had no idea what people of the big cities even looked like.<br><br><b class="ritt">I bet their skin is purple,</b> he chuckled, stretching his limbs with his eyes still shut. <br><br><b class="shavvy">Broaden your thoughts. There are far more colors out there than just purple, little one.</b> <br><br>
        The velvety voice that reverberated in reply shook Rittze from his drowsy musings and all at once he rose up – scrutinizing his surroundings for its source. He was sure he had come in alone, and at any rate this voice was unfamiliar, almost seeming otherworldly. <br><br><b class="ritt">...Who are you?</b> His stance was defensive. The air around him whipped away at the delicate gifts beside him. How could someone have followed him so easily? The thought shook his nerves, especially since he had always been quite proud of his keen senses. <br><br><b class="shavvy">My my,</b> the voice echoed once more. It was deep and rich, but it felt laced with warmth that slowly eased his tension. <b class="shavvy">Still your powers, young elemental,</b> The voice coaxed him gently - a tinge of laughter in his words, <b class="shavvy">this is no place for violence. I simply came to speak with you.</b><br><br><b class="ritt">Speak with me?</b> Rittze snapped, turning his head as he searched the cavern left and right for shadows or signs of any figures. His fright had given way to annoyance now, and he barked back at the ethereal voice in agitation, <b class="ritt">how am I to speak with someone if they won't even show themselves?</b> <br><br><b class="shavvy">Because you're not looking hard enough,</b> the voice answered back - harsher in tone this time, <b class="shavvy">as I said, expand your mind.</b> <br><br><b class="ritt">Expand?</b> Rittze's face scrunched, <b class="ritt">what game are you playing?</b> <br><br>
        The voice simply repeated itself; but this time it came from the center of the room, high above Rittze's head. Looking skywards, the young man's face paled as before him a large serpent-like creature glowered down at him - its massive girth filling the majority of the cavern's ceiling. Vibrant blue marks lined its tan scales while the darkened pair of eyes it sported kept a firm hold of Rittze's own. Two lengthy horns rested atop the beast's forehead - long and blue as if the embodiment of the sky itself. <br><br><b class="shavvy">Good,</b> the same voice, which had seemingly been taunting the young man before, now had a solid form attached to it – one Rittze had not been expecting. Slowly it descended a portion of its body as clawed feet came to rest upon the head of the statue Rittze had been talking to. The two figures shared a striking resemblance; and, in that instant, the young man knew just who it was he was speaking with – his deity. Almost instantly, the air around him came to a halt, and he fell to the ground on both knees with hands pressed against it in company. <br><br><b class="shavvy">Now he bows,</b> the deity chortled heartily, twisting its head to the side slightly as he eyed the young man before him - almost as if seeing right through him. <b class="shavvy">You are Rittze, of the Paizen Clan, are you not?</b> The beast asked, feet clenching and un-clenching against the stone under its talons. <b class="shavvy">I know what it is your heart seeks,</b> it spoke again before hearing the man's answer, <b class="shavvy">to venture out into this world. To find your 'second birth' – but you're hesitant, doubtful even.</b><br><br>
        Rittze nodded his head, still eyeing the ground with his head lowered. <br><br>
        An awkward silence passed before the deity let out a yawn. <b class="shavvy">Stand up,</b> it then commanded, <b class="shavvy">there is no need for formalities between us. Your kind may see me as a god, but I am no such thing. There's no cause for any worship here.</b> <br><br><b class="ritt">What?</b> The thought escaped Rittze's mouth before he could catch himself - the idea of speaking informally with a being his people had worshipped for centuries brought a boggling sensation. He chanced looking up to re-affirm the statement he'd heard and was greeted by those dark eyes once more as two tendrils of fur danced outwards from the beast's chin. <br><br><b class="shavvy">Stand up,</b> It repeated, motioning with a claw towards Rittze, while it began to settle itself onto the statue in a resting posture - the rest of its long body curling around the base platform. But where Rittze should have felt panic, like a rat caught within the grip of a snake, he felt calmed instead by the beast's movements and chose to heed his words. Standing slowly, he came to eye level with this mighty creature. <br><br><b class="shavvy">See, this is much better,</b> the creature blinked as somewhat of a smile appeared at the edge of his long snout. <b class="shavvy">Now, I have a favor to ask of you,</b> the smile quickly faded, <b class="shavvy">have you heard the story of the Council of Six?</b> <br><br><b class="ritt">Of course,</b> Rittze answered quickly. It was a tale told many times over and one almost every member of demonkind knew. <b class="ritt">Everyone knows about the Council,</b> the young man motioned with his arms as he spoke, <b class="ritt">but how's that relevant? What do you need me for?</b> <br><br><b class="shavvy">I cannot tell you everything,</b> the beast sighed back, looking upwards and closing his eyes as if recollecting, <b class="shavvy">but what I can say is that your destiny is not far off. There's a reason you feel as if this island isn't where you belong - that the outside world full of sights unseen calls to you.</b> <br><br>
        Its head fell back down and once again their eyes met.  <b class="shavvy">Beyond these seas lay a vibrant universe - one that will show you the true nature of this world. Once there, perhaps you will encounter many hardships; but with these mistakes will come growth, and with that growth your rebirth. Your story is one I cannot see the end of, but it is one I that will bring light to others. This is the favor I ask – that you will travel to these lands. You'll know what it is I mean for you to find, when you reach it.</b><br><br>
        The beast paused. <br><br><b class="shavvy">You remind me of my brother, little one. He had dreams far bigger than himself while I was ignorant… no, I was a coward,</b> the beast's tone was far more somber and Rittze stood quietly as he listened to its words, <b class="shavvy">I watched as he was torn asunder and thrown into a cruel wasteland like meat to a flock of vultures. And what was his crime? It was faith – simple faith, that he could make the world a far more welcoming place, to all manner of beings.</b>
        Rittze recalled the story of the Council, and before he opened his mouth to question if this is why the creature had asked if he knew the tale, he stopped, watching as the beast's eyes saddened and claws tightened around the statue on which it perched. <br><br><b class="shavvy">I know he is alive now, I can sense him every day. But my powers are weak and I came to this Island seeking shelter many decades ago,</b> the creature heaved a mighty sigh and the warmth of its breath brushed past Rittze's skin as the sweet smell of the Toppoa followed. <b class="shavvy">So what I ask of you, little one, is that you go in my stead. Find my brother and aid this world,</b> the beast rumbled. <b class="shavvy">Now, what do you say, Rittze, of Clan Paizen? Will you venture forth?</b> it eyed the young man as it spoke - watching as he knelt down to pick up his satchel. <br><br>
        Pulling it close, he swung the woven bag over his shoulder, and turned to leave the room, making sure not to step on the beast's coils. As he approached the cavern's entrance, he reached out to grab the base of his still burning torch from its holder. <br><br><b class="shavvy">What are you doing?</b> <br><br>
        Rittze looked back over his shoulder to the beast's call, as the hum of wind gathered around him excitedly. <br><br><b class="ritt">I'm starting my story.</b><br><br></p>

            <div id="three-column" style="position: relative;">
                <div id="mutant-col" style="position: relative;">
                <h3>Helmfirth<br>
    A World Divided</h3>
    
    <p>Rittze's story takes place in a world called Helmfirth. Forged by Gods, who have remained obscured through time, the vast domain once existed as a united plain where humans and demons originally co-existed. Rather than actively ruling over their creations, the Gods elected instead to create fifty Archdemons - to act as caretakers of the world in their stead: governing over various aspects of life and death in order to assure that balance and order were maintained. The lands that exist throughout Helmfirth are greatly diverse, ranging from wild and unchartered territories, filled with vivid, magical beasts and scattered populations, to technologically sound hubs bursting at the seams with bustling communities.<br><br>
    
    Following an ancient conflict, known as the Council Wars, which saw a clash between humans and demons and the emergence of a new race, which came to be known as mutants, the world was forcefully divided by the Gods and separated into two plains of existence. One of which would become the Demon realm, and the other, the Mortal realm. This was done in an attempt to pacify the quarrelling quarters, giving both mortals and demons alike domains to govern as they saw fit. Tensions have since improved over the centuries, with humans, demons and mutants having learning to live together, if not tolerate one another.<br><br>
    
    The two halves of Helmfirth are not mirror images that directly reflect one another, though the resemblance between the two plains is undoubtedly present.<br><br></p>
    
                </div>
                <div id="demon-col" style="position: relative;">
                
                <p>While the mortal realm continues to believe that the demon realm is a hostile and dangerous place, the reality is that this world is just as vibrant and unique and remains home to the Archdemons, the Council of Six and the remainder of Demonkind. Beyond the reaches of settlements not run by Archdemons however, the demon realm can be an unforgiving and dangerous terrain where the only law that exists is to eat or be eaten.<br><br></p>
    <h3>Novanae – Utopia</h3>
    
    <p>Within the upper half of Helmfirth, dominated by mortals, lies Novanae - a futuristic city largely occupied by mutants and humans who live together in scarce unity. Novanae is divided between two portions, Undertown and Utopia. Although Novanae is one city, Utopia functions as an administrative capital and is set apart from Undertown.<br><br>
    
    The beautiful city is suspended high above the grungy metropolis beneath it, where its glittering lights and flawless architectural marvels may be seen from miles around. A majority of the city's human population reside in Utopia, often living in obscene wealth and isolation from the squalor of Undertown. <br><br>
    
    Another defining characteristic of Utopia lies in the four waterfalls that flow in a streamlined cascade over the side of the shining city and down into a grand lake situated in the heart of Undertown. The water is cycled back up into Utopia, forming an infinite loop which many mutants have come to view as a mocking display of power and implied perpetuity of mutant oppression and human supremacy. <br><br></p>				
                </div>
                <div id="halfling-col" style="position: relative;">
                
    <p>Movement between the two cities is heavily regulated, where citizens of Utopia would have no obstacles in visiting any destination below and beyond. Whereas humans have no difficulty, the residents of Undertown would likely be unable to afford the exorbitant cost of a ticket to board one of the many enhanced zeppelins - which are required to reach the floating municipality. <br><br><br></p>
    
    <h3>Novanae – Undertown</h3>
    
    <p>Undertown, in stark contrast to Utopia, is where a majority of mutant-kind dwell in a near-constant state of conflict and strife among each other. Here, crime and corruption overshadow the once colourful city which continues to deteriorate with the lack of any real form of governance and continued exploitation by Utopians.<br><br>
    
    That isn't to say that many haven't made a life for themselves in spite of often unfavourable living conditions. Undertown has long been home to many individuals who possess a diverse collection of abilities ranging from powerful telepaths and clairvoyants to those whose only skiII is to simply be able to change TV channels with the blink of an eye. <br><br>
    
    The city has long been divided into varying turfs and territories which remain under the control of various independent factions. Be it rowdy thugs or highly organized mafia-esque organizations like the Goon Squad. Under the leadership of a mutant called Uhnka, the Goon Squad (GS) serves as a chaotic good force with individuals who remain devoted to the task of rebuilding Undertown.<br><br></p>

    <h3>The Tiers</h3>			
    <p>While the world of Helmfirth is shared among humans, mutants and demons, the lattermost are often sorted into tiers based purely on power. Naturally, these tiers bring with them ramifications of classism and an added layer of politics that overlay the already complex existence of demons living alongside humans and mutants.</p>
    <h3>The Archdemons</h3>
    <p>Residing at the pinnacle of power are the strongest of demons, the Archdemons. As they were created by the Gods, each with a specific purpose to serve, they possess their own special abilities and unique powers. This rank is often worshipped as deities or kept alive through stories, songs and myths passed from generation to generation - of both the human and demon realms.<br><br>
    Unlike the demons belonging to the lower tiers, the Archdemons are shrouded in great mystery. Unseen by mortals and rarely sighted by demons, it is, however, still possible to encounter them in disguise. For instance, <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Haootia">Hao</a>, the Lord of Time, has a tendency to enjoy people-watching in Undertown while <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Gharren">Gharren</a>, the Lord of Life and Death, eventually takes an interest in personally watching over a particular soul with exceptional circu.mstances.<br><br>
    It is believed that without the Archdemons, the world would fall into an irreparable state of chaos. Much like the Gods, the Archdemons have no desire to actively rule over the demon realm, though their powers easily supersede those in charge.</p>
    
    <h3>The Council</h3>
    <p>Beneath these guardians are the Council of Six. </p>
    
                
                
                </div>
                <div id="demon-col" style="position: relative;">
    <p>The Council comprises a group of siblings who were parented by two powerful ancients who are said to have had power on par with Archdemons.<br><br>
    
    While the origins of the Council remain un.clear, their status as rulers in the demon realm goes unquestioned. Their thirst for power led to the Council Wars, and the subsequent downfall of Kabhu, the youngest sibling.
    <br><br>Kabhu was viewed as a traitor for his meddling in the wars when he took side with humankind, creating the mutant race in order to assist humans - seeking to balance the playing field.</p>
    
    <h3>The Lords</h3>
    <p>Beneath the Council are the Lords. This class refers to those who are significantly stronger than the masses and it is comprised of a varied range of Demonkind. Those within this tier may come close to rivalling Council members, though most are ascetic or prefer to govern small territories granted to them by the Council.<br><br>
    While this rank is viewed as the most desirable, Lords often face the greatest risk of being targeted by other Lords in the pursuit of gaining more power. Lords are of course not limited to residing on the demon plain, as can be seen through the demons <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Odtio">Nuke</a>, Kala, and <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Jamari">Jamari</a> - who have chosen to, somewhat, aid the Goon Squad.</p>
    
    <h3>The Masses</h3>
    <p>Further down are The Masses who make up a significant portion of the demonic race. Their power can go between the mid ranges to coming close to matching Lords in strength and capability. This group face the constant struggle of <i>eat or be eaten</i>.</p>
    
                </div>
                <div style="position: relative;" id="halfling-col">
      
       <p>This mentality is exemplified in demons capacity to gain both an increase to abilities and power through the consumption of other demons.<br><br>
    
    A majority of demons who have opted to settle in the mortal realm are a part of this tier, seeking to escape the constant threat of death. They are joined by Loas and Lesser Demons in the lowest tiers, who are seen as the weakest and easiest of prey.</p>
    
    <h3>The Loas &amp; Lesser Demons</h3>
    <p>While these fragile creatures may see this as the most disadvantaged class, their cunningness often exceeds those who belong to The Masses, and oftentimes, even those further above. To make up for their weakness, this tricky nature gives this class a fair chance for survival alongside their ability to adapt to harsh environments.<br><br> 
    
    This tier is divided between the Loas who are required to form pacts with humans or mutants in order to survive, where lesser demons live free of a parasitic existence. <br><br>  
    
    That said, to wield a Loa takes a strong host, and an incompatible match is often to the detriment of the host. A Loa meanwhile only grows in strength with age, and willingly shares that strength with their host. <br><br>
    
    It is possible to contract multiple Loas, as seen with <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Voodacious">Vou</a>, or to simply bond with one as in the case of <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=FuuDogged">Fuu</a>. It is vital to note that aside from the Archdemon tier, there is flexibility for demons to ascend tiers, often by means of consuming significant amounts of demonic power.
    <br><br>However, this process is both difficult and an exhaustively long process, thus it isn't often that demons move from within their tier.</p>

    <br><h2>Races</h2><center>
    <p>The races that exist across this universe are commonly categorized according to the following four groups: <b>Mutants</b>, <b>Demons</b>, <b>Halflings</b> and <b>Humans</b>. These characters are just some of the few in Rittze's vicinity, and serve to exemplify the colourful range of narratives that are apparent - no matter what one is identified as.</p>

    It's safe to say that the Goon Squad would be at a loss without <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Zhram">Zhram</a> and his visions of the future: the humble 'shadow king' of the group, his insight into forthcoming events have often guided the group's direction and set <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Uhnka">Uhnka</a> at ease about his decisions. Soft spoken and highly personable, Zhram is often responsible for the induction of new members into the fold, where he continues to figure as an elder brother to all with his calm words of advice.<br><br>
    As comforting as he is to others, his visions are often jarring and at times relentless, and have long since robbed the man of the ability to sleep. He fills his time with his passion for technology, hacking and programming – often accompanied and assisted by <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Four_K">4K</a>, an artificial intelligence who gained physical form through supernatural means beyond Zhram's awareness. He may have many sleepless nights, but they are certainly far from lonely. </p>

    Born into captivity, <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=FuuDogged">Fuu</a> was raised in the company of other mutant minors while forced to engage in cage fights held across the gambling districts of Undertown. His natural strength, stamina and agility, alongside his tenacious fighting spirit helped to sustain his life. These qualities eventually drew the attention of a wandering Loa, which is a type of demon dependent on a strong host body.<br><br> 
    It chose to form a pact with Fuu, lending him its strength to break free from his bondage, and elected to protect Fuu for the rest of his life. Liberated and newly empowered, Fuu was quickly discovered by Kabhu and adopted into the safe hold of the GS group, where his talents in combat continue to be honed and are highly valued - though not as much as he is, as a person, and their precious youngest member.</p>

    A new face in Undertown, <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Jamari">Jamari's</a> only connection to the dusty city lays in his rivalry with Kala – a demon he had challenged and was easily defeated by decades before. The loss made a permanent impression on Jamari – waking him to the realization of his own limitations, and to a new awareness of something bigger missing in his life.<br><br>
    Where anger has fast melted into admiration, Jamari now pursues the pale demon's path, eager to take part in whatever new adventures may lay at this senior demon's side. An altogether outgoing personality, Jamari fails to take offence easily - often handling Kala's rebuffs without taking it to heart. His patience has earned him the respect and trust of Kala's older brother, <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Odtio">Nuke</a>, who likes to keep a passive eye out for the younger demon in the rough city they call home.

    A mystery to all but his older brother, <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Odtio">Nuke</a> – Kala is an ill tempered ancient whose motivations in aiding the Goon Squad outwardly appear driven by his older brother's involvement - rather than by his own desire. At least, that may be what he'd prefer you to believe.<br><br> 
    
    A feisty personality, Kala has a tendency to speak his mind and does not suffer fools gladly, which typically puts him in good company with Isiedro - one of few individuals who frequently tolerates his callous manner. The two shared a residence for a time – of which Kala thoroughly enjoyed, despite Isiedro's apparent disinterest in the man's advances.

He keeps track of managing properties, businesses and human resources on Uhnka's behalf.<br><br>
    To outsiders, he is more widely recognized as the owner of <i>Ulysses</i>, a popular night club in Undertown which serves as a safe hold for the group and its informants. Isiedro's composed façade conceals a snarky personality that typically surfaces around those he's close to, though despite his seemingly cold disposition, Isie cares deeply for the welfare of Undertown, his subordinates, and the safety of those within GS.

                <h3>Mutants</h3> 
    <p>
    Unlike humans and demons, who were created by the Gods of Helmfirth, the origins of the mutant race may be traced back to a single well-meaning demon of the Council of Six: Kabhu. These first mutants were created in the likeness of man which allowed them seamless integration into society in spite of the special abilities which set them apart. During the Council Wars, man and mutant lived together in harmony, united against demonic factions who sought to enslave the human race in a persisting quest for dominance. However, following the Council Wars (which saw mankind victorious), the gratitude human beings felt towards mutants fast turned to jealousy and resentment as the young race's gifts no longer served the humans any purpose. The relationship between the races grew strained as humans slowly sought to oppress the mutants they feared would grow to supersede them.<br><br>
    
    As the mutant race evolved over time, their appearances began to assume greater variance, mutating as it were and adapting traits regarded as far more demonic. The catalyst for this change is unknown, though it is regarded as simple evolution: comparable to man having evolved better immune systems and fewer teeth. The difference between mutants is still vast between appearances and abilities, with some who may appear extraordinarily ordinary, to those who seem far more otherworldly. At heart though, mutants share far more in common with humans than with supernatural beings – they require food, shelter and many of the same basic needs in order to survive. Undertown remains one of the most populous mutant hubs, and it continues to attract mutants in spite of the city's crime rates.

                <h3>Demons</h3> 
                <p>
    The Demons are a strong and proud race and also the oldest of them all. The word 'demons' in this universe describes this race without the connotations of evil that people commonly associate them with. They can be kind and good, as seen with Kabhu and most of the Archdemons, or they can be malevolent and vindictive, as a majority of the Council have come to be. The losing faction of the Council Wars, demon numbers are far fewer than those of mutants, and greatly exceeded by humanity - who are viewed as a bane by those old enough to have survived the war. While the demons do enjoy a prolonged lifespan, they aren't truly immortal and do age - though at a very slow pace. The only true immortals are the Archdemons.<br><br>
    
    Another feature that sets these beings apart is their ability to create both contracts and pacts with humans and mutants - loaning their strength to those they deem worthy. This is most commonly seen among the lowest classes of demons; however, it is possible for any demon of any tier to form pacts with non-demonic individuals of their choice. A majority of the demon race have opted to remain in the demon realm, though many weaker demons have long sought refuge in the mortal realm - in order to escape the greater threat of being devoured. Despite the origin of mutants being tied to Kabhu, a majority of demons neither view nor accept mutants as their kin. That said, the purists have also dwindled in their numbers, leaving far more open-minded demons to embrace closer ties with mutants and humans alike, as seen through Rittze's own mixed family.

                <h3>Halflings</h3> 
                <p>
    Although relations between humans, demons and mutants may have had tumultuous beginnings, time has allowed for old wounds to heal - and as a result the races have since intermingled, giving rise to Halflings. While the term is broad and commonly refers to individuals who share more than one bloodline, it is seldom polite to refer to individuals by this label as it may be read as a criticism of the purity of one's heritage. Instead, most opt to be addressed by whichever half of their bloodline they identify with. Naturally, this archaic view has grown old, as Halflings are a fairly common occurrence - even if some remain ignorant of the fact throughout their lives.<br><br>
    
    A notable feature of most Halflings, specifically those who share in demon and mutant blood, is that their powers are often stronger than their pure-blooded, mutant counterparts. They often enjoy prolonged youth and are far less susceptible to human or mutant weaknesses - though they are far from infallible. On the other hand, those who share in demon and human blood make for a slightly less harmonious blend. They occasionally face unexpected and unpredictable side effects of their abilities if any manifest, or face physical strain as their minds and bodies attempt to negotiate harnessing a power it may struggle to adapt to. More often than not, their appearances are far more human and typically: the stronger the demonic ancestor, the better these halflings fare. Last but not least are the mutant and human mixes – by far the most common type and hardest to detect, which explains why generations of mixes may pass by before a 'mutant' child emerges from an otherwise 'human' family.

        <h3>Humans</h3>
        
    <p>
    Last but not least in the line-up is the human race. Following the Council Wars, mankind remained the dominant group present throughout the world – both in the mortal and demonic realms. While human beings continue to face the usual struggles: age, illness, poverty and the like – they are also the most technologically advanced race, having dedicated generations towards finding new ways to maintain their dominance. Capable of both great kindness and malice, the human mind remains an enduring enigma to most demons - who have a tendency to be confused by humanity's baffling and contrary nature.<br><br>
    
    Some notable successes of this race include: the development of cities, such as Utopia, which possess space-age conveniences, down to the invention of devices capable of limiting mutant's gifts. While the technology is still in its infancy and isn't failsafe, the progress that has been made is often cause for concern for the oppressed mutants.<br><br>
    
    Humans who reside in the demon world are of a slightly different ilk than their counterparts in the human realm. Often more open-minded and adventurous, these souls are far more humble and less concerned about politics and power. Many reside within the safety of cities governed by Archdemons, in which demon, human and mutant alike are required to abide by laws or risk exile. It isn't odd to come across those who live as nomads in the demon realm either, occasionally humans may form pacts with demons, who in turn mark their charges and extend their strength to them – such bonds are most commonly found between lovers or those who have simply forged an unbreakable connection, as the pacts are never to the benefit of the demons though it is theirs alone to offer and likewise, revoke.<br><br></p>

Within this universe, the Council members are villains who exploit others within Undertown as each one is still fighting to destroy the other in a tricky game of chess. A game of chess, that is, in which mutants, demons and humans form their pawns.</p> </div>
    
    <div id="kabhu"><blockquote><h3>Kabhu</h3>
    
    <img style="padding: 10px; float: left; margin-left: -250px; width: 660px; margin-top: -100px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/AftAgt8.png"><p><img style="padding: 10px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: -130px; width: 120px; margin-right: -89px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/cek25Ut.png">
    Kabhu is, and has always been, a little bit different from his older siblings. A warm and benevolent spirit, he took pity on mankind during the brutal bloodshed of the Council Wars. Eager to give humanity a fighting chance, and subsequently challenge his power-hungry siblings, Kabhu created the first mutants in the likeness of man. This likeness was in order to keep his interference hidden from prying eyes, and to keep both man and mutant united in their struggles. However, years later, Kabhu's efforts would be uncovered. Unable to fight against the combined strength of his siblings, Kabhu's powers were separated and devoured by his kin; while his body was abandoned to the scorching desserts of the demon realm and he was left for dead.<br><br>
    
    That is, until Uhnka, a young and powerful mutant was led to Kabhu in order for a pact to be formed that would see Kabhu's life renewed. With his fate then forever bound to Uhnka's, and the remainder of his strength freely shared with him, Kabhu and the young mutant were thusly joined at the hip. Far from thrilled at their new dependency on each other, Uhnka and Kabhu struggled for quite some years before finally seeing eye-to-eye. But once that point was reached, the next three hundred years would be aimed towards the same dream of stopping Kabhu's siblings, the Council, and the destruction they so sought to bring upon the world.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bCSDEgV.png" style="width: 120px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 0px;">
    
    Kabhu is the patron demon of the Goon Squad - a fact which is kept privy to members of the Squad. He holds multiple contracts with most members which bind their life force to his – offering them enhanced abilities and a longer lifespan to aid in the group's unified mission.

    Shavyne felt he was always caught between a rock and a hard place – unwilling to voice his thoughts or concerns against his, far more, cruel siblings. Often choosing to hold his tongue in the presence of great injustice, Shavyne was a demon wrought with self-hate and a warm heart that longed to show its true colors. With age, Shav has come to loathe his past decisions, admiring the kind and brave spirit of his younger brother, Kabhu, who risked life and limb to help those who would never know how great a cost Kabhu paid in order to save them.<br><br>
    
    Eager to atone for his past of inaction and idleness, it was Shavyne who first discovered Uhnka - a wild and untamed mutant with a rebellious soul in need of guidance. Seeing the strength of heart and mind in this young mutant, Shavyne saw the opportunity for what would make an ideal link between his fading brother and the world he pleaded not to leave.<br><br>
    
    Rescuing his brother was the first action Shavyne could take personal pride in, and was thus followed by the silent abdication of his position in the Council. Opting to go into hiding on the island of Laisne in the mortal realm, Shavyne lay in wait for many years - feeling isolated from the potential wrath of his siblings, who he knew had begun to question if Kabhu managed to survive their final judgement.

    Often referred to as the 'Foolish Tiger' in many Helmfirth myths, Ryoukue is an overly aggressive and imposing spirit who feels inadequate beside both his younger and older siblings. Ridiculed for his lack of intelligence amongst his elder brothers and sister, Ryoukue has developed a rather fanatical obsession of gaining power. Oftentimes lost out in the wilds, hunting for demons to aid in his power hungry delusions, he is, more often than not, ignorant to the scheming of those around him.<br><br> 
    
    At the heart of his drive, Ryoukue desires nothing more than to overthrow his kin - taking rule over the whole of Helmfirth and all creatures that live within it. Much like the title his folk stories suggest, Ryoukue is neither clever nor cunning - as the delusions of grandiosity he possesses serve to be his Achilles heel.<br><br><img style="width: 120px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 30px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/YGSGFuj.png">
    
    Ryoukue is the patron of a gang known as Sigmatix - who reside in Undertown, and are the first real threat that faces off against the Goon Squad.  An otherwise small group, Ryoukue's pact with its members serves as a strong enough boost for the 4 member team to threaten even Uhnka's streets. That said, the visible leader of Sigmatix, a deranged young mutant known as Ayuj, appears to be in greater control of future plans than even Ryoukue cares to acknowledge - as he stands blinded by his own pride.

    Like her appearance, you could think of Hex as much of a Queen Bee as you could see a Black Widow. A real femme fatale, she looks down on her younger siblings and views Kabhu and Shavyne as hopelessly weak hearted. Ryoukue is no safer from her seething dislike, and is viewed with almost nonexistent respect - after all, he is the <i>Foolish Tiger.</i><br><br>
    
    Hex's admiration for her older brothers is tinged with jealousy, aware of their strengths and intelligence; she emulates them and is typically meticulous and careful in her planning. She has a tendency to bathe in compliments, and pity the fool who insults her unending "beauty.<br><br>
    
    But Hex's downfall comes in the form of both her vanity and her sadism. With her tendency to over praise herself and her intellect, these delusions will often take away from her abilities to successfully play chess with her pawns.<br><br><img style="width: 120px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 30px; margin-top: -5px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/qtKrlep.png">

    In spite of Nox's animalistic appearance, he is one of the wisest and most calculative members of the Council. He does not waste time looking down on his siblings, nor does he look up to his older brother, Xiahn. Nox's approach to the power struggle is to be patient and wait - well aware that the likeliest scenario to play out will result in his siblings ending one another, leaving a vacuum of power.<br><br> 
    
    Nox is one of the first to learn the truth about the Goon Squad and its links to his youngest brother he believed had perished, though he keeps the knowledge to himself – biding his time as he waits for the perfect opportunity to break the organization apart from inside. He's not partial to compliments, and cares not for a lack of them thereof - preferring to keep both his thoughts and ideals to himself. What may seem like a slow and senseless lizard to many, Nox knows, will have the upper hand when the time to strike reveals itself.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KOYUyFJ.png" style="width: 120px; float: left; margin-top: -10px; margin-left: -10px;">
    Nox is patron to a gang known through Undertown as RiPTide. A far more organized group in their ability to collect intelligence than those of his siblings, he and RiPTide will prove a most difficult chapter for the Goon Squad.

    Xiahn is the oldest and most deadly of the Council. Much like Hex, he has a rather playful, sadistic streak and possesses no visible inklings of compassion. Steadfast in his own beliefs, he cares not for the banter of his younger siblings - choosing instead to use his powers as both intimidation and reason enough to follow his commands.<br><br>
    
    Although as powerful as Xiahn is, he is the only Council member unable to take the guise of a human; and, is instead perpetually stuck in the shape of a young boy with a severed head - or, his far more gruesome demon form. He seeks to remedy this accursed situation - and will do so by using any means necessary... or anyone necessary. <br><br>

    <p>With consideration to Rittze's story and character, I have thought about several other looks for him: in a Laisnean temple where he encounters Shavyne for the first time, overlooking the city he has come to love, basking in the fresh air of an untouched part of the island or working at a day job he enjoys. As you can probably tell, I'd have the most fun customizing Rittze.

The two have been inseparable ever since and so naturally, when Rittze made the decision to leave his home, Apple was sure to follow, secure in his arms. Although she is slow, with poor eyesight and a tendency to sleep for the better part of the day, this warm and loving critter shares a special bond with Rittze and she is nothing less than perfect in his eyes. <br><br>
    
    
    You may find her curled up on a satin pillow, dreaming the day away at the Golden Lotus Café where she has widely come to be regarded as their mascot.</p>

    <h2>Other Plans</h2>
    <br><br><div class="contentsm">
      <h3>Character Development</h3>
    
    <p>As you've now learned, Rittze is a part of this rather young universe that is still in a steady state of development between Iggy and I. While I haven't had as much of an opportunity in the time spent crafting this application to adequately show you more of Rittze's interactions and full back story, it has not been neglected without cause: as we work on tightening our story with interest to move towards a fully realized comic script and some new characters are being introducted earlier than before, certain back stories are evolving slightly from their original concepts - including Rittze's. <br><br>We do use Neopets as a platform to engage with those interested in our stories, and a couple of users have been especially helpful in asking questions which help us to troubleshoot possible plot holes - or simply to spark new twists, and I adore that about this site. There's no doubt that Rittze would continue to be developed - it's fairly obvious, I think, that he's one of my main-cast favourites. In addition to that, it goes without saying that Ritt would have a lookup to best present his customizations, and very likely a rehashed or simplified version of this application for his petpage.</p></div><br><br><div class="contentsm"><h3>Beauty Contest</h3>
    
    <p>As for BC-ing - I will admit, I don't BC fairly often as these character designs never manage to be Neopet enough, however, I do thoroughly enjoy rising to the challenge when I have Iggy for company in the form of tandem or complimentary entries as we have done in the past:</p><br><center><div id="tandem">

    <br><p><b>Sigmatix: </b>A gang from the first arc and one of the most entertaining and destructive forces.</p>
    </center><br><center><div id="tandem2"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Aj6fnCn.png" title="Haforaa by me; He was adopted in September 2015 and this was his first BC Gold."><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jM9sROh.jpg" title="Qhuo by Iggy; His form is far more accurate here, though sadly it was not Neopet enough to compete."></div></center><br><p>
    Tandem Space Week entries between <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Haforaa">Haforaa</a> and <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Qhuote">Qhuo</a>, whose stories are closely tied: Haforaa is a detective put on the task of trying to track down the illusive Goon Squad, while Qhuo's task is to keep Haforaa off the group's trail. Qhuo was sadly kicked from competition for being overly humanoid, an issue we both frequently face – however, it doesn't deter us from trying.</p>
    
    <center><p>Ritt would likely end up in tandem entries with Fuu. <img src="http://images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/angel.gif"></p></center></div><br><br><div class="contentsm"><h3>Neoboards</h3>
    
    <p>Barring the last couple of months which were particularly rough between my studies and home life - I'm usually very active on the boards. Were I to have Rittze, I'd certainly be happy to post with him, especially given this absolutely perfect signature my good friend <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=xenobia_clair">Ren</a> created on request for the occasion: the choice of quote reflects Rittze's adventurous nature.</p><br><div id="siggie">

    <h2>Why Rittze</h2>
    <p>
    Have you ever had one of those moments when you're alone with your own thoughts, not concentrating particularly hard on thinking before – BAM! Inspiration sparks, and a vision hits you. For the first time, you see the face of a character you feel you've known all along, and all too quickly there's a new voice in your psyche urging you to tell their story?<br><br>
    
    That's what happened to me with Rittze. He forced his way into existence, from his design to his personality and origins: all of the details fell into place with very little effort on my part and as a wise friend of mine has said –</p> <h3>those are the best kinds of characters'.</h3>
    
    <p>There is a little more to this back story: In late 2015, I had applied to adopt a UC Faerie Grarrl by the name of <b>ritteriz</b> – his name and appearance had been the catalyst for this particular sporty ray of sunshine I saw haphazardly bursting his way into the Goon Squad, changing it for the better. I applied at once, eager, excited and full of hope that Ritt could perhaps find a home with me. Sadly, Ritt's old foster experienced a family tragedy and unexpectedly expedited the adoption process and departed from the site. A friend of the foster posted on her behalf, citing that the finalists had already been selected, moments after I had submitted my application. Ritteriz was successfully adopted out in the end to someone; however he has now been frozen for months.<br><br>
    
    Immediately following that heart-breaking process, I tried as many do, to fill the void that was left with something else: a converted equivalent, in the form of an Invisible Grarrl (I cannot stand to look at the converted Faerie Grarrls, but that's another rant).</p><center>
    <sub>Note: Hover over image</sub><div style="position: relative;" class="imageWrapper">
        <img style="width: 400px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/TVG8UuP.png"><a class="cornerLink" style="position: absolute;"><center><p><b>A Quick Comparison</b></p></center><p>Like with most UCs, the Faerie Grarrl's look and feel suffered after conversion. Other than sharing colour palettes, it looks like a completely different pet: gone is the old grarrl's over-confident, smug countenance and posture, replaced instead by a rotund, perpetually grinning reptile making awkward hand gestures. There's no style or grace, and I find it the antithesis of its former counterpart.</p></a>
     </div><p><sub>↑ After conversion, Faerie Grarrls couldn't even get off the ground. ↑</sub></p>
    </center>
    
    <p><br>I changed Ritt/Ritteriz's name to Rittze, curious to see if owning the name alone would bring me some measure of comfort – but beyond this application, I do still consistently refer to him as Ritt and was never really able to get attached to 'Rittze the Invisible Grarrl'. Instead, I used his page to host my former application, which I had intended to turn into a project page – but instead of feeling motivated and inspired, seeing that blank image only made me miss the energetic visage of the original Faerie Grarrls more. While I was later doubtful that a project page would be effective in my pursuit, I did attempt to apply recently with it, for a WN UC Grey Ixi towards retrade - though it was adopted out to a loving permanent home with an amazing artist. This application marks my second attempt at applying for retrade purposes, and if need be, it won't be my last.</p><br><br><center>

    </center><br><br><p>I'm very attached to Rittze's character and appearance and while I may not be able to have the original pet that inspired him, I do believe Choralonae will help me trade towards an incarnate of him I can be very happy with and give me an avenue to continue toying with his look and story on Neopets.</p><br><br></div>
    </div>
    
    <div id="whyme">
    <div class="contentsm">
    <h2>Why Me</h2>
    
    <p>I don't think there's any perfect answer to this – since Choralonae went up for adoption, I've seen a glimpse of the work others have put towards creating characters specifically for him, or towards their true goals – so to specifically cite that I'm a role-player isn't much of a reason. There are many other talented, creative people remaining on this site and I can appreciate the variety of narratives, depth and design of what others have done and am <i>glad</i> to be part of the remaining collective that this adoption process has helped unearth. With that in mind, I hope that Rittze and this world in which the Goon Squad resides appeals to your taste. <br><br>These characters and world are a reflection of Iggy and I as people: our life experiences, music we love, art, comics, our diverse ethnicities, differing nationalities, and a shared love of politics and fiction. These elements have greatly shaped our world – in fact, many scenes that we imagine of Undertown are heavily inspired by sights of my own home city.</p><br><center>
    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/aWWLXKz.png" style="width: 150px;" class="y"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hJ5D6Sm.png" style="width: 150px;" class="y"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/WSY95lQ.png" style="width: 150px;" class="y"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KwXsB1Q.png" style="width: 150px;" class="y"></center><br><p>
    You could say that I'm quite fully invested into our story, and look forward to seeing it grow into something beyond little stories between us. As you might have guessed, we do live a fair distance apart and the things we share on Neo make for an enjoyable means of bonding and spending time together.</p><br><br></div>

    Now that you're familiar with Rittze and his world, I'm sure you're a little curious about me: I'm 25 and presently in the process of getting a Masters in Communication although I come from a background in Design. I'm the youngest in my family, with two older siblings: 11 and 8 years elder to me which makes for quite the generational (and culture) gap. They were both a huge influence in my life and I feel like I owe them the most thanks for helping me to grow. To tell you about how they have shaped me is about as much 'about me' as this can get. <br><br>My sister is a real-life prodigy, and often encouraged my pursuit of the arts while instilling a strong sense of confidence in me without which I never would have managed to navigate through numerous tribulations from schooling age well into adulthood. Her approval still means the world to me and her dry sense of humour is a quality that has rubbed off on me, though unfortunately her talent in the kitchen hasn't!<br><br>
    
    As for my brother, the best way I can describe our relationship is that he's the Sonic to my Tails – there for me at every turn, and a constant positive influence in my life (at least, 90% of the time – Our midnight runs for McDonalds probably aren't the best).</p> <br><br></div>
            <div style="position: relative;" id="right-column">
    <p>At the age of 8, he turned me onto anime and though I started with series like Slam Dunk and Samurai X, some of my favourites from his recommendations have grown to include titles like <b>Initial D</b>, <b>Gankutsuou</b>, <b>Sousei no Aquarion</b>, <b>Steins Gate</b>, <b>Last Exile</b>, <b>Shaman King</b>, <b>Vandread</b> &amp; <b>Black Lagoon</b>.

    </div><p>When I'm not busy drawing, writing, devouring series or playing around on Neopets - you can find me working hard on research for my Master's Thesis (which is currently centred around LGBT issues, with most existing research on my specific topic in this country being horrifically anti-LGBT and rife with researcher bias – Ack!). If not, I'm most likely outside chilling out on my hammock, talking to my friends who are all inconveniently far away (or on different time zones) or out at a nearby pool, swimming, if weather permits.</p></div><br><br><div class="contentsm"><p>Feel free to explore my accounts: Clicking pet names will take you to petpages, and avatars will likewise take you to lookups.<br> Do forgive me, but things are still a bit of a work in progress here and there.</p>

    At present, you have a nibble of a sense of what kind of person I am – but this app wouldn't be complete without telling you about the <b>real MVP</b> in my life in more than a passing mention. Iggy and I met in March of 2015 on Art Chat and became fast friends.<br><br> He participated in a theme week co-hosted by my friend Coffee and I and through his character design and art, sparked what some of our friends have fondly referred to as the 'Mutant Revolution' – encouraging several users to re-imagine stereotypically unattractive Neopets into one-of-a-kind characters (predominantly, you guessed it: Mutants).<br><br> Not only were Iggy's designs well conceived, but his character back stories were too – and it inspired me to want to get back to writing after a long period of staleness on my end. Of course, I was surprised to discover that Iggy had <i>never</i> roleplayed in his life but to my utter delight, he was open to the idea and was an <b>absolute natural</b> at it.<br><br> We now share a protected board online and have been developing the GS universe together since April 26th 2015. We also share hopes of serializing our story into a webcomic, and while that may come much further down the line as Iggy pursues a degree in Illustration and I get my career on track, Neopets is where we still enjoy spring-boarding ideas and sharing them with friends.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
    <p>The last 6 months have been dominated by making attempts to reach our final pet goals – and so the time I have spent on Neopets lately has largely been put toward co-crafting applications, some of which I believe you've already had the pleasure of viewing:</p>

    Congratulations, you've made it through this epic saga of rambles, Tempered! Thank for your kindness and understanding in extending the deadline. If not for your flexibility, this application would simply not have had the time to come into fruition. Believe me when I say there was <i>a lot more planned out</i> and still much more I wished I would have had time to write out or draw, but with three weeks of a short semester break to execute most of it...there was simply no way to give you an application akin to what you would remember of the old days (at least, not in a way that would pass quality control!).
    <br><br>That said, I hope this has still been a submission that was fun to read and explore and that you've enjoyed a glimpse into our world. Thank you also, for your enthusiastic, approachable persona as well as your willingness to disclose what you were hoping to find with these applications. Too often, this process feels like it turns into a stressful guessing game of trying to please a foster while truthfully proving one's worth, and this time around I felt like there was none of that fuss and pomp: I was genuinely free to just have fun with continuing to develop Rittze and sharing him with you, without any other concern or strain.</p><br><center><p>I have thoroughly appreciated this opportunity, no matter the outcome and wish you all the best with your own journey ahead: may it be an exciting one (free of Neo-censorship! Yes!!!).<br><br></p></center>

    <h3>Thank you so much!</h3>
    
    <p>
    
    <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=genderbent">Iggy</a>, I feel like thanking you in one line (much less a paragraph) isn't nearly enough to convey my feelings of gratitude – if not for you, not only would this world and any of these characters not exist, but my own reality would be so much less vibrant than what you've made it. Thank you for making the entirety of the last year into the <i>adventure of a lifetime</i> – for all the late night chats about our babes, for the epic collaborations, astounding art you've created (beyond this application), for constantly encouraging me, surprising me at every turn with your sharp mind and sharper wit and exceedingly entertaining plot twists! You are quite simply the best potato that ever rolled into my life and I appreciate everything you do, and everything you are.<br><br>
    
    I'd also like to thank you, <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=dawn_fairy">Dawn</a>, for so many things - again, I feel I can't adequately express how thankful I am to have you for a friend and for all the love and attention you've given this world and this application. I can say for sure that Iggy and I both enjoy keeping you entertained ♥<br><br>   
    
    Last but certainly not least – a HUGE thank you to the friends who have supported me in the process and creation of this application: <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=teraqa">Leana</a>, <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=coffeeink">Coffee</a>, <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=apfelcandy">Apple</a> &amp; <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=xenobia_clair">Ren</a> – for the months of support and encouragement, for always being so sporting to listen and offer feedback, if not simply for the extraordinary faith you put into my abilities. You are all darlings in the truest sense of the word.<br><br>
    
    Thank you also to friends who have supported me in the past in my pursuit of Ritt: <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=annnoel">Ann</a>, <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=narutoluvr935">Naru</a>, <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=caterait">Cati</a>, <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=gorubeza">Dusk</a>, <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=winner19955">Winnie</a>, <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=gryph_beams">Jenny</a>, <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=_koolness_">Kaz</a>, and many other friends on Art Chat - without all the kind words, gentle encouragement, art, and your own stories of perseverance, I'm not sure I would have come this far.<br><br></p>
