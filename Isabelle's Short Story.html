    <h1>No name for this yet D:</h1>
    <p>The rain beats a solemn staccato on the roof.
    </p><p>Somber clouds had materialized out of nowhere, devouring the tranquil sky in one fell swoop. One after another the drops crash down, each pitter and patter making me cringe. The sound feels like pinpricks on my skin. <i>Make it stop</i>, I wanted to cry, <i>make it all stop!</i>
    </p><p>My lips don't move. In fact, I cannot even feel them on my face. Nothing exists but the raindrops impinging the earth. I tell myself to breathe, <i>just breathe.</i> It brings me a moment of peace, a fleeting one. My muscles begin to tense, locking my arms and legs in place. <i>Keep breathing.</i> My mind goes blank so all I can focus on is the pain. The pain makes my body scream the way my mouth can't. <i>Exhale, inhale, exhale.</i> Then my lungs collapse, my throat tightens up, and I can't budge an inch.
    </p><p>I can feel the weight of the skies crashing down on me, crushing my chest and suffocating my breaths. The rain has become a violent torrent, an ear-piercing shriek to me. I try to convulse my limbs in every direction but they still do not move. My eyes, wide and frantic, burn with unshed tears that churn with fear, frustration, and fury.
    </p><p><i>Please,</i> my mind yells, though I don't know who I beseech. God? The words begin to slip from my head as my thoughts grow hazy. The edge of my vision clouds with darkness as everything slips away.
    </p><p>I go slack, and my lips part ever so slightly. Only a hiss, strangled by invisible tendrils locked around my neck, escapes.
    </p><p>And I finally open my eyes.
    </p><p>I shoot straight up, trembling with terror and gasping for air like the desert anguishes for rain. My hands instinctively grab my face, groping for the assurance that I still exist. I curl my toes, then test my legs. <i>Everything's intact. Everything is fine.</i>
    </p><p>A barely-audible sigh marks my relief. I dash a sleeve across my forehead, wiping away the constellation of sweat. <i>I didn't cry this time</i>, I realize. I had been having nightmares like that ever since I was a child, always an indication that some doom will befall me. After the first time, when I was seven, I lost my parents. Then, years later, death purloined my brother. There is no one left but me. Perhaps that is why I remain unafraid, <i>Nothing of value remains to be taken.</i> Still, an icy shiver slithers up my spine.
    </p><p>In the peripheral of my vision, I spot a dark figure, hunched over in the corner of my room. It doesn't catch the moonlight, but appears benevolent, like a mother cradling her child. A few blinks sharpen my eyesight and I realize it's just my metal coathanger, bent under the weight of the many jackets.
    </p><p>I rest my head down again, searching for a merciful drowsiness to steal me from the night. I do not find it. So I lay there. Though I have been alone for years, I for the first time in a long time, feel absolute, sheer loneliness.
    </p><p></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Oz6EUTr.png"><p>The morning comes in the form of a golden medallion ascending from the horizon, casting its benign glow onto the world. Such light can almost make me forget the horrors of the night before. After all, how can such malevolence exist under the vigil, omnipotent sun?
    </p><p>My legs know where I need to go before I can even think to go there. I leave my house, still dressed in my nightgown that shifts its pattern from stars to rain. The open air is fresh, almost exhilarating. It buzzes with the new life spring always delivers.
    </p><p>Bountiful buds bloom in my garden, turning the modest patch of soil into an eden of flowers. I cross them, heading towards the lake, its magic glimmering in the callow light of dawn. The allure of playing and swimming my trouble away tugs at me but I press on. I reach the waterfall that cascades like soft silk, breaking into a mist of tiny droplets. I pass it and hike up a winding stone path to the grand, marble temple.</p>
    <p>I release the breath I didn't know I was holding. After all these years, it remains arduous and dreadful the same: visiting the grave of my deceased family.
    <p>ã€€"Mother, father, brother, I hope your rest remains a peaceful one," the words come out more choked than usual, "I had another one of <i>those</i> dreams last night. It's been years so it came as quite a shock to me. ...But, at least it means I'll be joining you soon."
    <p>I fall silent, staring at the three limestone stabs, each one representing a chunk of my soul carved out of me. They represent happier times, places, and states of mind that will never return. <i>What else is there to say? How are things? Is it nice up there?</i> Talking to the deceased is like talking to a mirror; it doesn't hold answers to the questions you ask and you're only left contemplating about yourself, wondering if you're truly as empty as you appear.
    <p>I won't be lonely anymore at least. It's a relief, knowing I'll be in a better place. But in the same token, it's agonizing seeing myself in these tombstones, knowing that my time here has nearly caught up to me. There are so many places left to see, so many tasks undone, too many promises I've made to myself I've yet to uphold. <i>I'm not done with life yet.</i>
    <p>For the first time since my brother passed, I'm going down to Earth. It is finally time to leave the safety, familiarity, and dissonance of my home. I will die among the humans.
    <p>Before I leave, I turn and head towards my river. It is the one thing I will miss more than the morning glow turning my room into a beacon or the peaceful, velvety silhouette of twilight enveloping me into blissful slumber.
