<b>Forever</b> by <i>Fireflight</i><br><br>
Sometimes I feel so cold, like I'm waiting around all by myself.<br>
Loneliness gets so old. I'm in the lost and found, sitting on the shelf.<br><br>
Been stuck for way too long (I hear your voice) You're who I'm counting on.<br><br>
Oh, tell me you're here, that you will watch over me forever.<br>
Oh, take hold of my heart. Show me you'll love me forever, forever.<br><br>
I know that you can tell when I start to let my hope fade away.<br>
I need to catch myself. Open my ears to hear you calling my name.<br><br>
Been fighting way too long (I hear your voice) You had me all along.<br><br>
Oh, tell me you're here, that you will watch over me forever.<br>
Oh, take hold of my heart. Show me you'll love me forever, forever.<br><br>
When I'm starting to drown, you jump in to save me.<br>
When my world's upside down, your hands they shake me and wake me.<br><br>
Oh, tell me you're here, that you will watch over me forever.<br>
Oh, take hold of my heart. Show me you'll love me forever, forever.<br><br><a name="stats"></a><h1>Statistics</h1>

<i>Clean:</i> I'm pretty clean but that's cause I was brought up this way. My room can get pretty trashed sometimes. The maids just come and clean it up though. Then I feel bad.<br><br><i>Nice:</i> I'm SUPER nice! I'm one of the nicest people you'll probably ever meet. Like. What I did for Khy. That was beyond nice. The nicest thing ever done ever!<br><br><i>Social:</i> Oh everyone already knows I love to talk. I'll talk to anyone. Or anything. I've talked to the flowers before. Talking to flowers helps them grow!<br><br><i>Leader/Follower:</i> Technically I'm supposed to be a leader and have been brought up that way but I'd rather be like everyone else. But then again I don't like being told what to do so that would make me more of the leader instead of the follower. I don't know! I'm confused now!<br><br><i>Outgoing:</i> I loooooove going out! Oh, that's not what this means? Oopsies.<br><br><i>Creative:</i> I love to sing and dance. I wish I could draw. But singing and dancing is just as creative! It's just like a different type of art.<br><br><i>Hardworking:</i> Again, brought up this way. I've never really been allowed to be lazy. But I do get to relax and like what TV sometimes.<br><br><i>Impulsive:</i> Oh my gosh if I see something I want, I get it. Like. I saw this super cute shirt at the market the other day and I bought it. Even though it was green. And I don't like green. It was still cute. And I don't really think before I do things. I just get so excited!!<br><br><i>Relaxed/Tense:</i> I'm pretty carefree I think. But I also have to be like all snoody sometimes as the Queen. I don't know. I'm like right in between here.<br><br><i>Intelligent:</i> I'm definitely not stupid! Who said I am?! Jerks!

<b>How old are you?</b><br>
I just turned 19!<br><br><b>What makes you special?</b><br>
Pfft, a lot of things! :P I'm the Queen. Of course I'm just special overall!<br><br><b>What is the most normal thing about you?</b><br>
There is nothing normal about me! Well.. sometimes I wish there was.. No, wait, scratch that. Normal is boring.<br><br><b>What is the last thing you ate? </b><br>
I made these scrumptious muffins for Khy and I! At least I thought they were delicious anyway.. Khy is just picky.<br><br><b>What is the last thing you did prior to this interview? </b><br>
Baked those yummy delicious muffins! I've been trying to learn how to cook because I've been soooo booorreedd lately just running around the palace.<br><br><b>With whom did you last share a hug? </b><br>
Khy :D He needs to be more of a hugger. Who doesn't like a hug??<br><br><b>What do you look like? </b><br>
Hehe, I'm about 5 feet tall. I haven't really checked my exact height lately but I probably should.. *runs off to find Khy and a ruler*<br>
Khy says I'm about 5'3". Which makes me short but adorable! I have shorterish blonde hair. I'm trying to grow it out. It was a terrible decision cutting it off! Ummmm... I have blue eyes and porcelain skin, or so people say. Not a single freckle in sight *mumbles* thanks to makeup.. The palace wants me to wear all these fancy dresses but they're so heavy and uncomfortable and tight! Oh my GOSH they are so tight I can't breathe. So I like to go shopping for clothes and I found this really cute hoodie and theses adooorbs shorts. I wear them most of the time. With white sneakers. Heels are so overrated. Oh oh oh and I have a few piercings too, which are normally forbidden but hey, I'm the Queen now. So I can do what I want! ^^<br><br><b>How do you feel about your appearance and how does it effect your life? </b><br>
I think I'm pretty good looking. Sometimes I wish I didn't have to wear makeup to feel beautiful but oh well. No one really knows I wear makeup anyway! I do sometimes feel like the kingdom expects me to be this beautiful Queen.. and I don't really meet their standards.. but... oh what am I saying! No negativity, Pel! Negativity is for ugly people.<br><br><b>Do you ever change your appearance (make up, tattoos, etc)? </b><br>
I would looooooooove to get a tattoo oh my gosh!! But Khy has to go with me everywhere and he refuses to let me get one! Rude. He says it wouldn't be attractive. I think it would be pretty awesome. Maybe if I can sneak out... Oh and I wear makeup. Like every single day.<br><br><b>What sort of first impression does your appearance leave on others? </b><br>
When I HAVE to be dressed up, of course people instantly realize I'm the Queen. Then they treat me like the Queen and not like an actual person. But when I go out with Khy and I'm dressed in just my hoodie and shorts people don't realize right away that it's me. So then I get treated like a normal person! Sometimes it's a good thing. I don't know. I'm weird! :D<br><br><b>What family do you have? </b><br>
When I was younger, my mother and father were around. Then like.. around the age of seven they just kind of disappeared. The help around the palace said that they went on a long journey to another kingdom. They still haven't returned. It's funny, cause as soon as they disappeared, that's when I met Khy! He was like.. what? Fourteen at the time? He got locked up for stealing or something. I was super duper curious and snuck down to the dungeon and that's when I met him. He was like bleeding and stuff and I was super into sewing at the time so I fixed him up good as new! When I turned 18 I was in charge and I told the guards to release him. As long as he became my body guard. It was so sick what they were doing to him in there. So I like.. rescued him I guess! He's the only family I really have now unless you count the palace staff.<br><br><b>How is your relationship with your family? </b><br>
I. Love. Khy! Oh my gosh. He's like the older brother I never had. He puts up with a lot, hehe. Seriously, I love being around him. Like. Every morning I wake up I run to his room and wake him up just so we can hang out outside of the palace and stuff.<br><br><b>What do you do for a living? </b><br>
Er. I'm the Queen! Haha. Honestly though it comes with a lot of responsibilities that I don't want. Like. I wish Khy could magically become the King or something so that he can take over. I never asked for this role! D:<br><br><b>How do you feel about death? How do you view your own death? Does this vary from your view on the death of others? Do your feelings towards death effect your life in any way? </b><br>
Ew I don't want to talk about that.<br><br><b>What do you do for entertainment? What do you do in your free time? What hobbies do you have? Is there any activity that you have a preference for? Any unusual entertainment choices? How'd you get involved with those hobbies? </b><br>
I love love love going outside of the palace and shopping for like clothes and like food and stuff. I just like getting out of the palace. It's so boring in there. We have so many rooms and for what? It's only me, Khy, and the staff. Like. We don't need that many rooms. And there's like noooo furniture! It's super weird. I want a nice cozy house. Not this huge cold palace..<br><br><b>What sort of diet do you have? Do you eat primarily processed or fresh foods? Are there any dietary restrictions? If so, why? What's your favorite and least favorite food? </b><br>
I eat everything and anything. Except fish. I'm allergic. And they smell bad. But I looooove food.<br><br><b>Where do you live? What is your home like? Where is your home located? </b><br>
I live in my palace thing in the middle of the Gemini Kingdom. You can thank me for that lovely name! :D I already described the palace kinda, haha. Sorry. I tend to ramble a lot!<br><br><b>What injuries have you had in the past? Have there been any major injuries? Which have been worse, emotional or physical injuries? Are there any injuries which caused lasting damage and continue to effect you? </b><br>
I've never been majorly hurt. Khyome makes sure nothing happens to me. Which is good. I don't think I'd have a high pain tolerance. I'm delicate! He even freaks when I get like a scratch or something. Like I'm going to die from a scratch.. oh my gosh. But it's cute that he cares that much, hehe.<br><br><b>How do you view love? Do you believe love exists? Do you believe love at first sight exists or does it need to grow? What's your opinion on soul mates? </b><br>
Oh. My. Goodness. I'm such a like hopeless romantic. I love sitting on the couch with a tub of ice cream watching soaps. Like. Johnny and Claire are SO meant for each other. Why can't she see it? Is she like blind or something? It's SOOO obvious!! There's totally such a thing as soulmates. And like love at first site is totally a thing too. That's like the only way people can fall in love! It's just like this instant spark! And BAM you just know, you know?<br><br><b>What kind of music do you enjoy? Why do you like that particular music? Did you grow up with music around you? Do you sing or play any instruments? </b><br>
I looove to sing. I think I have a beautiful voice. I rock out standing on my bed with a microphone, listening to like the newage pop music. That's the best. Khy just can't know, oh my gosh. I would DIE if he saw that *blushes and covers face*<br><br><b>How do you feel about the night? What is your preferred activity at night? What time do you generally go to sleep? Why? </b><br>
NIGHTTIME?! I LOVE the night! I love space and like going out in the garden to just lay there and look at the stars! Wanna know a little secret? Khy took me out to the garden on my birthday cause he knows that's like my favorite place ever.. and when we were gazing at the stars I noticed the Gemini constellation was like seriously directly above the palace. On. My. Birthday. It was totally a sign! So I renamed the kingdom!<br><br><b>How do you feel about pets? </b><br>
Ehhhh that's one thing I don't really care for. They need a lot of attention. And like, I like that attention. Why should something else get more attention than me?? D:<br><br><b>What scares you? </b><br>
Spiders. Oh em gee. If there is a spider in a room I will avoid that room until Khy finds it and smooshes it. They're just so creepy! And like you see one then look away then look back and it's gone. No way man. Huh-uh. Ain't dealing with that.<br><br><b>What is it that you desire? </b><br>
To be freeee. I don't want to be the Queen. I don't like these responsibilities. I just want to be like everyone else..<br><br><b>What is your idea of a perfect society? </b><br>
I haven't really thought about it. But everything would be covered in flowers. Because flowers are beautiful and smell awesome! :)<br><br><b>If you could have any superpower, what would it be? </b><br>
Invisibility! Then I could sneak out of the palace sooo easily. I could just like disappear and they'd have to find a new Queen.<br><br><b>What do you own that is considered extravagant? </b><br>
...this entire palace. And like everything in it. And it's so funny because I don't even like anything in here. I appreciate smaller things. Khy found this rock that looked like it had a smiley face on it, *whispers* even though I think it just had bird poo on it.. and I appreciate that more than anything else in this palace. I love nature. Not marble.<br><br><b>What brings you peace? </b><br>
Nature. Stargazing. Being with Khy. He always knows how to make me laugh. Even when he's not trying. He's just such a weirdo sometimes.<br><br><b>Well, that about sums it up then. Thank you, Misspel!</b><br>
Thank you <a href="/~biometric">A.B.C.D</a> for interviewing me. <br><br><a name="story"></a><h1>Story</h1>
Chapter 1: Abandoned
<div id="scroll">
I was a very small child when my parents were taken from me. At that time I really didn't know what was going on. I heard a crash and many of the guards were running to my parents' room. It was the middle of the night and I was pretty scared… The guards don't just freak out over nothing. I opened my door to look outside and see what was going on but one of my favorite guards was standing outside. His name is Hugo. He's kind of like a second dad to me. He saw me peeking out and sternly told me to go back in my room. Stubborn little me said no of course. Then he opened my door and picked me up and plopped me down on my bed. He tickled me like crazy, haha. I think it was to distract me from what was really going on now that I think about it. <b>Hugo, will you read me a bedtime story?</b> I asked. <font class="other">Sure, Miss Pelia. Which book would you like me to read?</font> I took my favorite book out of the drawer of my nightstand and handed it to him. It was a hopeless romantic princess and a thief story. I don't know why I loved it so much. I think Hugo got tired of reading it to me to be completely honest. Oh, I should probably mention I was five years old at the time, and already a romantic!<br><br>
Hugo was about halfway through the book when another guard burst through my door. <font class="other">Hugo! Come quickly!</font> Hugo closed the book and hurried over to the other guard. He turned his head and looked at me. <font class="other">Stay here Pelia. Lock your door.</font> I was scared again, all alone in my room. What could be such a huge deal that all the guards, even Hugo, have to be running around like crazy? I opened my book again and continued to read where Hugo had left off. The story played in my head like a movie. I could see the princess and the thief clearly in my mind. I always pictured myself as the princess because, well, I was one! I always liked the idea of this girl helping and changing this thief to be such a great guy. She never saw him as a thief, she saw him as a person. Anyway, the chaos outside my door started to calm down. I got up off my bed and looked out my door again. This time there were no guards to stop me. It was pretty silent in the palace so I tip toed out of my room and started heading towards my parents' room. I was reaching for the doorknob when Hugo picked me up. I whined <b>Hugo, put me down!</b> He carried me back to my room as I rolled my eyes. This time he softly sat me down on my bed and kneeled in front of me. I could feel something was wrong. <font class="other">Miss Pelia, I want to let you know that your parents have left due to an emergency. I'm not entirely sure when they will be returning.</font> <b>Oh.</b> I said. I didn't really know how to respond. They've never left me without saying goodbye first. It must have been a really bad emergency.<br><br></div>
<br><br>
Chapter 2: A Boy
<div id="scroll">
I couldn't sleep that night. I just had a really bad feeling that something was wrong. I walked around my room but I just needed some fresh air. I walked out to the hallway and was heading towards the front side of the castle. I had to pass the staircase that leads down to the dungeon/prison part of the castle. It had been unused the entire time I was alive so I never really bothered to go down there. As I was walking by I heard a cough echo from down there. Instantly I stopped walking and stared at the staircase. I heard rustling around and knew someone had to be down there. It was probably a guard but my curiosity got the best of my and I slowly and quietly walked down the stairs. I peeked around the corner and saw… a boy. He was locked up in one of the cells and bleeding pretty badly. He was facing the wall so he didn't see me but I could see his back was all torn up. He was seriously just a kid. I couldn't let him suffer like that. I ran back up to my room and got my sewing kit. Mom and I used to sew together all the time. I went back down to the cell and the boy was passed out this time. He was laying on his side completely asleep. I was small enough that I could fit through the bars of the cell. I used to play in them until the guards told me to stay away from there. I snuck in and carefully stitched up the wounds on his back. Every twitchy movement he made caused me to jump, haha. I didn't want him to wake up with me sticking needles in his back.<br><br>
I finished stitching him up then went back upstairs to get that fresh air I wanted earlier. I had to make a pit stop by a bathroom to wash my hands. I definitely didn't need a guard questioning why I had blood on my hands. I walked outside to my favorite place, the garden. I got up and sat down on a bench. I leaned back and stared up at the beautiful night sky. It was impossible to clear my head. All I kept thinking about was that boy. Why did the guards lock him up? Why was he all torn up? What on earth happened?? I started getting really tired so I went back inside and up to my room. I slept forever it seemed. A full day, actually. Hugo came into my room the day after and woke me up for dinner. He said he had tried waking me up yesterday and for breakfast that current day but I wouldn't budge. He figured the chaos the other day mentally wore me out which, I guess it did? I don't know. I just… slept… for a long time. I'm not sure why. Anyway, I walked with Hugo to the dining hall and crawled up onto the chair at the end of the long table. I ate until I was full and asked Hugo if I could be excused. He didn't see me grab a loaf of bread from the table. As I was walking to my room I passed that staircase again. I looked around and didn't see anyone so I snuck down there again. I kept the bread hidden behind my back. I got to the bottom of the stairs and saw that boy staring at the clock on the wall. I kinda froze and didn't want to move but he saw me anyway. He looked over at me and my heart stopped. I took a deep breath and got a little closer to the cell. I got right up to the bars and brought the bread I was holding around to my front. I went to hand it to him but he jumped at me and snatched it from my hands. I was completely startled and jumped back a little. I stood there staring at him, taking it all in. He devoured that bread like he hadn't eaten in days. When he was finished eating I decided to at least say something. He had just been staring at me too. <b>My name is Pelia.</b> I said softly. He asked me for water in a very dry voice. Thankfully I had also remembered to bring him a flask of water. I reached through the bars to hand it to him, tightening up a little waiting for him to jump at me again. But he didn't. This time he gently took it from me and sipped some of it. <b>How is your back?</b> I asked. He had the look of complete confusion on his face. Maybe he didn't even know he was stitched up? <b>Your stitches.</b> I continued. <b>How are they holding up?</b> I grabbed the bars to get a closer look at him. He still looked confused. <i>You… you did this?</i> he stuttered. <i>But you're only a child.</i> Pfft, who is he to call me a child? <b>So are you, silly.</b> I replied, because he was just a kid too!<br><br></div>
<br><br>
Chapter 3: A Friend
<div id="scroll">
I visited him pretty much every day. Anytime I could sneak past the guards, anyway. Most of the time I was busy practicing being the new queen. Oh yeah, I should probably mention that word came back that my parents passed away on their way to whatever emergency happened. They had to sail to another land and their ship was taken out by a wave or something. I hadn't seen them in a few months. I don't know why I wasn't more upset. I guess I was just kind of mad that this responsibility was put on me now. Why would they do this to me? I wasn't able to visit that boy one day because I had more training. Walking with a book on my head, learning the proper way to sit, the proper way to wave. It was all so stupid. That wasn't me. Why did I have to learn any of this when I just wanted to change it all when I actually became the queen? It was just a huge waste of time.<br><br>
I was on my way down to visit that boy again but Hugo stopped me. <font class="other">Miss Pelia, you shouldn't be going down there. That boy is a monster and you shouldn't be anywhere near him.</font> I rolled my eyes. <b>I'm fine Hugo. I'll go see him if I want to. He's locked up. What can he do to me?</b> I was pretty mature for my age. I wasn't your average kid. I had a lot of responsibilities. That's why I connected with this boy too. He was mature for his age as well. It seemed like he had been through a lot. Hugo made me go with him though and learn certain emergency procedures if something was to happen in the palace again. I couldn't sneak my way out of it so I had to deal with it until it was time for bed. It was hard to sleep again. I tossed and turned, thinking about that boy. He had been in there for a few months. Then I realized he hadn't had a bath or anything this whole time. He had to have felt disgusting. I never really fell asleep.. I just watched the clock all night. It was really early in the morning when I decided to fill a bucket with water to bring down to him. I made a huge mess carrying that huge heavy bucket down the stairs but oh well. They were stone. It's not like it was going to hurt them. When I got to the bottom of the stairs I could see him actually standing in his cell. He was a lot taller than I had imagined. Until now I had only seen him sitting or lying on the floor. I put the bucket down on the ground and pushed it towards the bars of his cell. <i>What are you doing?</i> he asked me. I loved hearing his voice. He hadn't talked much but each time he did it made me happy. I giggled a little and replied <b>You're kinda smelly.</b> I didn't mean anything by it. He knew it too I'm sure. He looked down, I could tell I made him feel a little uncomfortable. But he looked back up at me and said <i>That bucket isn't going to fit through these bars, Pel.</i> I loved when he called me that too. Everyone in this palace was so formal. Miss Pelia. Pel was much more me. <i>That's why I brought a sponge!</i> I said. He smiled a very tiny smile but it was there. I saw it. Then he started to remove his shirt. I cringed, hoping he wouldn't catch his stitches. He reached through the bars and took the sponge from me and dipped it in the bucket of water. He first started to rinse off his face. All I could do was sit and stare at him… he was much more handsome than I thought. It was hard to really see him through the layers of muck and dirt all over him. He dipped the sponge in the water again and started washing off his arms. The water in the bucket was starting to get a little dirty but it wasn't as nearly dirty as he was. I saw him struggling to reach his back. He kept hitting his stitches and hurting himself. <b>Do you want some help..?</b> I asked, secretly hoping he would say yes. He hesitated a minute then slowly handed me the sponge and sat down with his back near the bars of his cell. His stitches looked fantastic! <b>I'm awesome.</b> I said which made him laugh and that made me smile! I very gently scrubbed the dirt off his back and cleaned his wounds. I was so focused on not hurting him I almost didn't hear him when he said something. <i>My name is Khyome by the way</i> Once it finally registered in my head I said <b>Khyome… I like that name.</b> I finished cleaning off his back and he asked for the sponge again. He dunked it in the bucket and squished it over his head and let the water run through his longish black hair.<br><br></div>
<br><br>
Chapter 4: A Promise
<div id="scroll">
A few years passed by. I still visited Khyome almost every day. The guards no longer tried to keep me from seeing him because they knew I would find a way to sneak down anyway. I had been visiting him for years and he never hurt me or anything so I guess they just really didn't see too much of a problem with it anymore. I had just finished another agonizing lesson about being the queen and all the stupid responsibilities I'll have. I was so sick of them… it had finally gotten to me. I ran out of the room and down the stairs to Khyome. God, I hated those bars. I just wanted to run to him and hug him. That's all I needed was a hug. But I ran down and fell to my knees in front of his cell. I was sobbing so hard into my hands. I couldn't even think straight. I could barely hear Khy ask me what was wrong. <i>Pel, come on. Calm down. Everything will be okay. Just tell me what's wrong.</i> he said. I finally managed to catch my breath and I looked up from my hands. <b>I don't want to be queen, Khy…</b> I whispered. I went back to sobbing in my hands again. I felt Khy move my hair behind my ear. <i>You'll make a great queen though. I know it.</i> he said. I kinda snapped and accidentally yelled at him. <b>But I don't want to be the queen! I never did and now I'm forced to!</b> I saw the look of sadness on his face too, like he felt my pain. Out of nowhere he said in a very gently voice <i>I will always be here for you, Pel. I promise. I will take care of you. I don't really know how, but I promise I will.</i> Without any hesitation, I reached through the bars to hug him. Even with the bars in the way it still felt incredible… to finally be able to touch him and have him hold me. I wiped my eyes with my hands and calmed down a little. There was so much going through my head. <b>Khy…</b> I said softly. <b>As soon as I'm officially the queen, wanna know what I'm going to do?</b> <i>What's that?</i> he asked. <b>I'm going to release you. I promise. I hate seeing you in here You are so sweet and so kind and you don't deserve this.</b> I grabbed his hand through the bars and held it tightly. He didn't respond like I thought he would. <b>I promise that I will release you as soon as I turn eighteen. That's only two years away.</b> <i>Pelia…</i> he said, taking his hand out of mine. He looked at me, worried. I thought he would be excited… what was he hiding from me? <br><br>
We heard a guard coming down the stairs but I didn't run away anymore. They knew I was down here all the time and they couldn't do anything to stop me. Khyome didn't want to get in trouble for being near me so he slid back away from the bars a little bit. It was a newer guard bringing Khy food. I saw that it was a single bowl of soup. That's not enough food for a whole day, I seriously need to have a talk with these jerks. The guard threw the bowl in Khy's cell and it broke on the ground. That was it, I had had it. I stood up and yelled <b>How dare you?! Who do you think you are? I know you know who I am. I demand that you bring him a nice meal and actually hand it to him you monster!</b> I felt my adrenaline and blood rushing like crazy, I was so mad! The guard bowed to me and ran to get better food. It was silent for a minute then Khy and I laughed a little. Tiny little me just scared off this huge muscular guard. I started imitating the guard and Khy and I were just having a nice time. When the guard finally came back, he had two plates of food. Turkey, mashed potatoes with gravy, and some corn. It was our leftovers from dinner earlier that day. He handed the plates to me, bowed again, then ran off. I sat down and handed Khyome a plate through the bars. It was our first meal together. <br><br></div>

Chapter 5: Her Song
<div id="scroll">
I was turning eighteen in a few months, meaning the training sessions were longer and more frequent. I was starting to hate everyone in that palace more and more and just wanted out… Any chance I got I would bring books and other random things to Khyome to give him something to do. I ran down the stairs one day and clung to the bars. Khy stood up and walked over to me. He had gotten so tall… I hadn't grown too much since I was thirteen but he just kept getting taller and taller. He was 25 now so it's pretty obvious I had to bring him new clothes from time to time. He didn't look like a prisoner anymore. He just looked like a normal person trapped behind these stupid bars. I was in a hurry because I had to get to another practice session but I just needed a break really quick. I handed him a book a said <b>This one is special, you'll see.</b> but I had to go so I reached through the bars really quick to give him a hug. I went back upstairs and I'm sure my cheeks were bright red. I was so embarrassed because of what he was about to read… I like to sing in my spare time and write songs. It has helped me through a lot of this. Khy doesn't know that I write and he has never heard me sing so this will be a surprise for him. I wrote him a song… on scented paper of course! This is how the song goes: <br><br><div id="song">
<b>Sometimes I feel so cold, like I'm waiting around all by myself. Loneliness gets so old. I'm in the lost and found, sitting on the shelf. Been stuck for way too long. I hear your voice. You're who I'm counting on. Oh, tell me you're here, that you will watch over me forever. Oh, take hold of my heart. Show me you'll love me forever… forever.</b>
<p align="right"><font color="#61c792">Forever - Fireflight (part one)</font></p></div><br><br>
That was all I had so far. Khyome had inspired me so much that all I wanted to do was write. He was all I could think about. I just hadn't had a lot of time because of all these stupid training sessions. That day dragged on forever. All I could think about was what he thought about the song I wrote for him. I was so sore from standing up straight and walking around with a dumb book on my head. I don't think anyone is gonna pay that close of attention to my posture. Seriously. I went back to my room and flopped down on my bed and fell asleep.<br><br>
I got up pretty early for some reason and actually felt refreshed. Khy hadn't had a bath in a while again so I grabbed a bucket and a sponge and stuff and I ran down to Khyome's cell but he was still sleeping. I had brought him some pillows and blankets so he could sleep better. Seems like it was working very well, haha. An hour or two went by of me just sitting there watching him sleep. Finally he turned over and opened his eyes. <b>Morning sleepyhead!</b> I said. <b>I've been waiting for you to get up.</b> He sat up and rubbed his eyes and ran his hand through his hair. I saw him look at his hand and his hair stayed slicked back. <b>I figured you would want a bath so I brought a bucket of water and some soap and stuff.</b> Since Hugo was the current guard on duty and I know he doesn't like to say no to me, I asked him to open Khy's cell so that he could have the bucket. He hesitated for a minute but then he picked up the bucket and unlocked his cell and placed it inside. Then he locked the cell again. Khy took his shirt off and started to clean his chest first. It was super awkward with Hugo in the room too so I blushed and turned around. I heard Khy laugh at me. I played with my hands and finally got the courage to ask him about my song. <b>So. Um. That song. What did you think of it?</b> I managed to spit out. Barely. Then I just started to ramble. I do that when I'm nervous. <b>I mean, obviously it's a work in progress.</b> I started. Khy cut me off a little and started to ask for a towel. Without looking at him, I grabbed the one hanging out of my front pocket and put my hand through the bars. He took it from me and chuckled. <i>You know, you don't have to have your back to me.</i> he said. <b>I know,</b> I replied, blushing like crazy. <b>But you're avoiding my question!</b> <i>I liked it a lot. It's really sweet. But you know I can't sing, right?</i> He was referring to one part of my song where I said he would sing. <b>Nonsense!</b> I said. <b>I'm sure you sound fine.</b> I knew he would because of his normal voice. There was no way his singing voice would be terrible with a normal voice like that. Khy told me he was done drying off and stuff so I turned around. I didn't know he was still shirtless and my eyes went straight to his abs. My first thought was <b>whoa…</b> haha. I wasn't expecting that. Apparently I stared for too long because he noticed. <i>Yeah I get bored and work out in here.</i> he said. I blushed and stuttered <b>I… I see that.</b> then I turned around again and put my face in my hands. It felt like it was on fire so I know it had to have been super red. <b>Oh my gosh, Pel. Here. I'll put my shirt back on.</b> I turned back around and apologized. I'm just not around guys a lot… so it's weird seeing one shirtless. And toned. Like, really toned. Khy told me that before he met me he wasn't around girls a lot either which is why he's so awkward. But I love his awkwardness! I looked over at Hugo and asked him to let me in Khy's cell. I saw Khy take a few steps back. <i>Uh, Pel?</i> he seemed super nervous. <font class="other">I don't think that's a good idea Miss Pelia… he's a criminal.</font> <b>He's not a criminal to me. Open the cell.</b> I said sternly. I walked in slowly and Hugo locked it behind me so Khyome couldn't escape. I rolled my eyes because he was being ridiculous. Khyome and I just kinda… stared at each other for a minute or two. He looked like he was going to have a panic attack. I got a little closer to him and in a soft voice said <b>Calm down, Khy. I just want to give you a real hug. I haven't been able to see you that much in a few weeks.</b> I raised my arms to put them around his shoulders but I had to wait for him to bend down first since he's way taller than I am. He wrapped his arms around my waist and I felt my heart flutter. Khy kinda cut the hug short though for some reason and backed up away from me. <b>Don't you have to be somewhere?</b> he asked me, looking down at the floor. Mixed signals much? <b>Probably.</b> I said and took a few steps closer again. I stood up on my tippy toes and kissed his cheek. <b>I'm so glad I met you…</b> I whispered. <font class="other">Okay, Miss Pelia. That's enough. You need to come out now.</font> I sighed as Khy sat down on his pillow and I walked out of his cell. Hugo locked his cell again and Khy and I waved to each other before I walked back up the stairs. I was so giddy, I skipped to my room and flopped on my bed again. I hugged my pillow pretending it was Khy. That hug was amazing! I wonder why he cut it short though… I hope I'm not bothering him or something. <br><br></div>
<br><br>
Chapter 6: Coronation Day
<div id="scroll">
The day had finally come! It was my eighteenth birthday! Man I had some big plans for this place. God, I can't wait to set Khyome free and get him out of that cell. He deserves so much more than what I can even give him but I hope it's enough to make him happy. I went through my closet, looking at the three fancy dresses I owned. I don't like getting dolled up but he hadn't seen me like this before so I wanted to look as good as possible. I tried them all on and inspected myself in the mirror. I decided on a pastel blue dress. I think it made me look the most grown up. I still had a few hours before I could make the big announcement. You have no idea how badly I wanted to get a nice outfit for Khy to wear to the ceremony but I just didn't have time. I had to do my hair, my makeup, make sure everything was set up properly, greet everyone as they arrived, etc etc. It was actually pretty stressful. There was music playing and people chatting. The maids were serving food to everyone. I was too nervous to eat. I love being in the spotlight, don't get me wrong. But I knew what I had to say today was going to upset a lot of people. But, oh well. I'm their new queen. They will get over it. <br><br>
Trumpets sounded and I was escorted up to my throne by one of the guards. It wasn't Hugo because I had ordered him to get Khyome instead. They needed time to get to know each other more. Hugo needs to learn to try Khy like I do. The throne room is gorgeous. Stained glass windows everywhere lighting up the room. The ceremony was timed so that the sun was beaming through the window behind me. It's for dramatic effect or something and it's a passed-down ritual. The time had arrived. The doors open and I saw Hugo with Khyome in handcuffs. I told Hugo not to put those ridiculous things on him but I guess I see where he's coming from. Kinda. Not really. Anyway. They both walked up to me and I saw everyone staring at them. Oh boy is this going to hit everyone hard. Once they made it up to the stairs leading up to my throne, they stopped and bowed to me. I looked in Khyome's eyes and saw fear but I also saw a slight hint of happiness. I smiled at him and took a deep breath. I stood up, cleared my throat, and in a… queenly voice I said <b>I order the release of Khyome. Our prisoner of thirteen years. His previous acts are to be forgotten, however, he will not be released out into the kingdom.</b> The crowd erupted with whispers and I looked down at Khy. His eyes widened and I saw that he was deeply confused. I smiled at him again and continued. <b>Khyome is to be my personal body guard. For eternity.</b> I declared. The crowd got even louder. I could barely hear Khy whisper to me. <i>I… I can't…</i> he stuttered. He was shaking so badly. <b>Guard, please remove his handcuffs.</b> I ordered. Hugo did just as I asked and Khy just stood there, frozen. <b>Khyome, stand by my side.</b> I said. He walked up slowly, still shaking. I could practically feel his heart beating. I wanted to get him out of the spotlight as soon as possible so he had a chance to take it all in and calm down. <b>Thank you all for attending my coronation today. Everyone is dismissed to the ballroom for food and festivities.</b><br><br>
Everyone had left the room except for the guards, Khyome, and myself. I motioned for the last of the guards to leave so I could talk to Khy alone. As soon as the door closed behind them I jumped at Khy and gave him the squishiest hug I could give. <b>I'm so happy to see you!</b> I exclaimed. <b>Today has been ridiculous.</b> <i>I… I'm happy to see you too</i> he hesitantly replied. I tilted my head a little, confused <b>Is everything okay, Khy?</b> I asked. <i>Yeah… I'm just… confused.</i><br><br>
I walked behind my chair and picked up my surprise for him. It was a palace guard's uniform. I handed it to him and said <b>Go take a real shower and put these on. Here, I'll walk you to your new room. It's right down the hall from mine.</b> We walked together down the hallway until we got to his new room. I pushed the door open and we walked inside. He stood there in awe, taking in everything. I pointed to the other door inside his room. <b>That's your own bathroom. Guess what. You and I can't leave each other now. Since you're my body guard, we have to be together at all times! The only thing is that we have to have separate rooms, but mine is literally right at the end of the hall. You and I are the only two with rooms in this wing of the palace. I'm sure you're excited to get a shower and stuff. I'll just be waiting out here for you since I can't go down to the ballroom without you.</b> He slowly walked over to the bathroom door and opened it. He walked in and shut it behind him. I heard him lock the door and I giggled a little. I laid down on his bed and relaxed for a minute. It had been a long day for me and it felt good to just not be on my feet. I hated wearing heels. I heard the water turn on in his bathroom. I could see the steam rolling out from under the bathroom door and I could smell the products he was using. My heart started racing. I couldn't wait to see him all clean and fancy. I tried to calm myself down by humming one of my songs. It wasn't working… then I heard the door open. I sat up so quickly and as soon as I saw him my eyes just started watering. It was unbelievable how different he looked. I could barely form words but I managed to squeak out <b>Oh my gosh… Khy… you look amazing!</b> I ran over and jumped in his arms. He smelled sooo good! And his hair! He cut most of it off! <b>You look like a whole new person!</b> The ball in my throat wouldn't go away and speaking was extremely difficult. But my tears were pure happiness. I ran my hands through his new short hair. It was so soft and clean now. Then he grabbed my wrists gently and pulled my hands down. He laced his fingers in mine. <i>I feel like a whole new person. It's all thanks to you..</i> I squeezed his hands and smiled through my tears.<br><br></div>
<br><br>
Chapter 7: A New Beginning
<div id="scroll">
<i>Are you ready to go down to the ballroom now?</i> he asked me. <b>I think the question is are YOU ready?</b> I replied with a giggle. <i>As I'll ever be.</i> He couldn't get any more romantic if he tried… oh my gosh. I blushed and, still holding his hand, we walked down to the ballroom together. Hugo was waiting outside the door for us. He bowed to us both and opened the door. There were two lines of men with trumpets, as usual with these kinds of ceremonies. They started playing and all eyes were on us. I loved it but I knew Khy felt uncomfortable. <font class="other">Introducing your new queen, Miss Pelia Lockhart, and her bodyguard, Sir Khyome.</font> Sir Khyome… has a nice ring to it. I felt him squeeze my hand tightly and I smiled even more. We walked over to my throne and I sat down. Khy bowed and stood beside me. I looked up at him and he looked back down at me, both of us smiling like dorks. I didn't want this moment to end, ever.<br><br>
The crowd cleared out and moved to the sides of the room. It was time for mine and Khy's first dance! Man, this is gonna be a surprise to him. A man walked up to us and informed us that it was, in fact, time for our dance. I stood up and brushed my dress off to get the wrinkles out then I turned to Khy and held out my hand. My heart started racing I was so excited! He just kinda stared at my hand so I whispered <b>Take my hand, Khy. It's okay.</b> He very gently grabbed my hand and while we were walking out to the dance floor he leaned over and whispered to me <i>Pelia… I can't dance. I don't know how.</i> I just smiled at him. When we got to the center of the floor, I walked in front of him and turned to face him. I took his other hand and placed it on my waist. At first he took his hand back and I saw him blush. I giggled a little and whispered <b>Just look at me. Don't pay attention to anyone else.</b> I put his hand back on my waist and the music started playing. We started dancing and let me tell you he was a natural. I don't know why he was so worried. I whispered <b>1, 2, 3, 4.</b> to him over and over and I think it helped him. He even spun me around and dipped me! I stared into his eyes for what seemed like an eternity. In that moment, everyone else disappeared. It was just him and I. He brought me back up and the music ended. Back to reality. Every clapped for our performance and him and I walked back over to my throne. I sat down and he stood next to me again. I totally heard him let out a huge exhale.<br><br>
Some other men would occasionally come up and ask for a dance which I couldn't decline even though my feet were bothering me. Stupid heels. Even while I was dancing with these others guys, I kept my eyes on Khy. I wanted nothing more than to just be with him and everyone kept taking me away. My Coronation Day was coming to an end finally. It was time for all of the guests to leave and the maids to start cleaning the palace again. I grabbed Khy's hand and told him to come with me. <b>Keep your eyes closed.</b> I said. <i>Where are we going?</i> he asked. I told him <b>You'll see. Just trust me!</b> I took him outside through the front door. There was a subtle warm breeze and you could smell the flowers from the garden. Birds were chirping and it was every hopeless romantic's dream. <b>Okay open your eyes.</b> He opened them and stared at me for a few seconds until he realized he was outside. He looked around at the sunset and took it all in. He put his arm around my waist and I felt my heart flutter again. We watched the sunset together like I always dreamed we would. He leaned towards me and whispered <i>By the way, happy birthday Pel.</i> <b>I was waiting!</b> Haha, actually I almost forgot it was my birthday. I was so focused on him and everything that happened today. Best birthday ever now that I think about it. Once the sun set completely it started to get a little chilly so we decided to go back inside. I could've stayed out there all night though knowing I had him to keep me warm. But we were both pretty exhausted and it was time for bed. He walked with me down our hallway and we stopped at his door since it was before mine. <i>Thank you Pel… for freeing me. I promise to be the best body guard I can be.</i> I didn't have words. I hugged him one last time that night and I softly ran my hand down his arm to his hand. I felt his goose bumps. We held hands for a little but then I turned to walk to my room. He didn't let my hand go until the last second when my fingers slipped out of his. I looked back and saw him smiling then I went in my room and shut my door. I heard him shut his right after.<br><br></div>
<br><br>
Chapter 8: A Quick Escape
<div id="scroll">
I need out of the palace, desperately. I was going stir-crazy. I needed to get out and shop for new clothes and music and everything at the local market. I remember Khyome bursting through my door that morning like something was on fire. <b>Khy? What's wrong? What happened?</b> I asked. I sat up feeling worried. <i>Oh.. uh.. nothing..</i> he stuttered. <i>It's um.. breakfast time?</i> I yawned and stretched. Boy, he must be hungry. <b>Oh, haha, I'm sure you're excited for that, huh?</b> I said. He nodded and said <i>I'll let you get dressed.</i> He closed my door and stood outside waiting for me. All I did was throw a white t-shirt on and grabbed some socks. I don't need to look like royalty to eat breakfast. I opened my door and we walked down to the dining hall. I sat at the end of the table and he sat beside me around the corner. One of the maids brought me my usual, frosted flakes! I already started eating when I realized Khy was just staring at all the food. Even with my mouth full of cereal I ordered a server to bring him one of everything. He actually somehow managed to eat all of it! I mean it was kind of his first real mean since being out of that cell.<br><br>
Once we finished eating I finally made Khy go out shopping with me. It's not too long of a walk down the road to the market. It's literally on the same street. People don't pay much attention to me when I go out in casual clothing which is what I want while I'm out shopping. But it was a little different with Khy this time. He was in his palace guard uniform so people were definitely looking our way. I should surprise him with new casual clothing when we go out. I'm not sure he'd actually wear it though. I think he really likes this outfit. It makes him feel… needed.. or important. We first went by the clothing stands and I got some cute shorts and new t-shirts. I was browsing through the guy clothing but Khy would know it was for him and it wouldn't be a surprise anymore. So I did the casual <b>You'd look super cute in this</b> while holding up a shirt thing. He didn't really say much. We then we ventured over to the produce stand. I waved to Margo, the lady working the stand, and filled a bag with stuff. Not much excitement there. Margo asked how my coronation went since she wasn't able to attend. She has to work the stand to feed her three boys. I always pay extra when I shop there. Next on my list was to hit up the music stand. I was flipping through CDs when Khyome grabbed my arm really quick. <i>Pelia, we need to leave.</i> <b>But I'm busy.</b> I whined and took my arm back. <i>Pel, seriously.</i> I could feel that something was up. He was acting really weird, looking all around us everywhere as we started walking back towards the palace. At least I managed to get a few things and the trip wasn't a total waste. The walk back was weird. Khy wasn't himself. He was really freaking out about something. He wasn't really talking to me and when he did it was just one-word responses.<br><br></div>
<br><br>
Chapter 9: His Song
<div id="scroll">
We finally made it back to the garden and I turned around to look at him. <b>What was that about Khy?</b> I asked with my hands on my hips. He seemed to snap out of that weird phase and apologized. <i>I'm sorry.</i> he said. <i>I just saw someone that looked suspicious and wanted to keep you safe.</i> It was kinda nice just being alone with him in my favorite place again. I was looking at the flowers when I heard him say <i>Hey, I made something for you.</i> I quickly turned around. <b>You did?!</b> I exclaimed. Then he handed me a folded up piece of paper. <i>You wrote a song for me. I couldn't sleep last night so I decided to write what I was feeling and turned it into a song… for you.</i> <b>Oh. My. Gosh! Khyome!</b> I was freaking out. I grabbed it out of his hands and started reading it right away. He put his arm around my waist and guided me over to the bench so I could sit down and read it. I didn't look up once until I was done. It read:<br><br><i>I've got this passion. It's something I can't describe. It's so electric, it's like I've just come alive. I feel this freedom now that my past is erased. I feel the healing, I found the meaning of grace. I found grace. If only you could see me yesterday, who I used to be before the change. You'd see a broken heart, you'd see the battle scars. Funny how words can't explain how good it feels to finally break the chains. I'm not what I have done, I'm what I've overcome… I know I stumble, I know I still face defeat. These second chances will define me. So I'm moving forward, I'm standing on my two feet. I've got momentum. I've got someone saving me. I'm what I've overcome. I'm what I've overcome…</i><p align="right"><font color="#61c792">What I've Overcome - Fireflight</font></p><br><br>
I didn't say anything for a little. I.. had no words. That ball formed in my throat again and a teardrop fell on the paper. Khyome lifted my chin up with his hand so I was facing him. He looked worried and I just stared in his eyes with more and more tears forming in mine. <i>Pel?</i> I blinked and tears streamed down my cheeks. <b>That was beautiful.. Khy.. wow.</b> I hugged him tightly and softly cried on his shoulder. <i>I thought you'd like it. It's a late birthday present.</i> he said. I tightened my hug and continued to cry tears of happiness. This couldn't be more perfect. I finally pulled away to look at him. He wiped the tears from my face and laughed. <i>C'mon weirdo. I don't want people thinking I upset you or something. Perk up!</i> I laughed with him and wiped my new tears. Then I realized I put eyeliner on that day. I quickly ran inside to freshen up and he followed shortly behind. I went into my room and left the door open so he would come in but he just stood there. <b>You can come in, silly.</b> He hadn't been in my room before. He hesitated a little but he walked in and… stood there. Awkwardly. <b>You can sit on the bed.</b> I giggled as I continued to apply more blush in the mirror over my dresser. Once I fixed all my makeup I turned around to get his opinion. <b>Well, what do you think?</b> I asked. He looked up at me and took a few seconds to answer. What was taking so long? Did it look bad? I asked if it looked bad but he quickly stood up and replied <i>No, no! You look fantastic Pel. You always do.</i> We both blushed and looked down. We were holding hands and didn't even realize it. Then there was a knock on the door. <font class="other">It's time for dinner, Miss Pel. You too, Sir Khyome.</font><br><br>
We walked down to the dining hall and both of us were smiling like idiots and holding hands. After dinner we hung out in my bedroom again. For the first time, I sang in front of him. It was very quiet but still. I was singing. He actually kept the piece of paper I wrote my song down on and he handed that to me. He asked if I wanted to sing that one. I looked at it for a bit and smiled. We were both just sitting at the edge of my bed but he leaned back and crossed his arms behind his head and closed his eyes. I started singing my song and added on to it this time. I got to the part where he would come in, I was about to sing it myself but then he actually sang it. I looked over at him with a huge smile on my face. <b>I told you!</b> I exclaimed. <b>You have a great voice! You sound just how I imagined…</b> I laid down beside him and continued singing the rest of the song. Then I added on to it.<br><br><b>I know that you can tell when I start to let my hope fade away. I need to catch myself, open my ears to hear you calling my name. Been fighting way too long. I hear your voice. You had me all along. Oh, tell me you're here, that you'll watch over me forever.

There was a knock on the door again. We both quickly sat up and Khy got up to open the door as I fixed my hair. Hugo was standing in the doorway out of breath. <font class="other">Sir Khyome. Please come quickly. Pelia, you need to stay here and lock your door.</font> Khy looked back at me and before I could ask him not to leave he was gone. I didn't even get the chance to give him a hug…<br><br></div>

Chapter 10: All Trust Is Gone
<div id="scroll">
I had no idea what was going on. Boy, if this isn't a repeat of my childhood. My room didn't have a window or anything so I couldn't look outside to see what was going on. With all the guards we have, though, I knew I was fine. I locked my door and went over to my desk and started working on some more songs. Knowing Khyome was dealing with something serious had me worried though. I couldn't really think straight. I'd get one line of words down then completely blank. My trash bin filled up with crumpled up pieces of note paper. I turned my music on to help me think but it still didn't help. I ended up just laying on my bed and waiting for Khy to return. I actually managed to fall asleep. I had an amazing dream about a wedding… but it was one of those fuzzy dreams you don't really remember, you know? Then I was woken up by knocking on my door. I didn't know how long I had been asleep. I was excited, thinking it was Khyome… I was dead wrong. I opened the door to see a hooded man and another guy. They grabbed me and before I could even scream for help they wrapped a cloth around my mouth. I was kicking and throwing punches but nothing was working. These guys were too huge. What did they want with me?? Oh yeah.. that's right.. I'm the queen. I'll mark that down on my list of things I hate about being queen if I survive this. I kept trying to yell out for Khy but my screams were too muffled and everyone was outside of the palace anyway. These two guys carried me down to, you guessed it, the cell Khyome was locked up in. They took the chair the guards normally used to sit on while watching over the prisoners and put it in the cell with me. I fought hard but to no avail. They got me in the chair and tied me to it with a whole bunch of rope. I didn't think I was going to ever see Khyome again…<br><br><font class="other">Pathetic excuse for a queen, don't you think Lorin?</font> the one guy said to the other. The other one just laughed. That.. Lorin guy locked me and this other guy in the cell and he stood over in the corner of the room, in the shadows. I was crying and having a panic attack. I was helpless and didn't know what to do. The one guy kept running his hands through my hair. Disgusting creep. Then I heard something going on upstairs. I managed to let out some muffled screams. Not long after, I heard someone running down the stairs. <i>Pelia?!</i> I heard Khyome yell. He got to the bottom of the stairs and saw me in the cell with this other guy. His eyes widened and he reached around to grab his bow. I tried warning him about the other guy he hadn't seen but it was too late… Lorin shot an arrow at him and it went clear through his leg. Khy dropped to the ground and I don't think I could've cried any harder. Khy managed to reach his bow and he got an arrow and fired it at the other guy. Lorin dropped and didn't get back up. I saw that Khy was in agonizing pain and it hurt me so badly that I couldn't help him. I just hung my head forward with my hair covering my face and cried. That's all I could do. Then I heard Khy try to speak. <i>Kanrik.. if you touch.. a single hair.. on her head…</i> Then that Kanrik guy grabbed my hair and yanked my head back. <font class="other">You'll what?</font> he said in a booming voice. It was terrifying and I winced from the pain. Khyome ripped the arrow through his leg… I could feel his pain. He stood up and aimed an arrow at Kanrik but then the next thing I knew was that I had an icy cold sword to my neck. Khy lowered his bow. <font class="other">Hello, Khyome. It's been awhile.</font> He removed the sword from my neck. <font class="other">My my. You've grown. You're what? 26 now? Time sure has flown by. What are you doing with this 18 year old beauty?</font> <i>I'm… her… bodyguard…</i> he said between breaths. He was obviously still in a lot of pain. Kanrik burst out in loud laughter. <font class="other">You're not doing a very good job of it! Why are you her bodyguard? After what you did to her parents, I'm surprised she can even look at you.</font> I turned to look at Khy. I had no idea what this guy was talking about. <i>Pelia, don't listen to him.</i> <font class="other">Oh! Oh this is priceless. She doesn't know!</font> My heart was shattering… I saw that Khyome was seriously upset… but… I couldn't look at him anymore. <i>Pel, please… please don't listen to him…</i> Khy begged. Just hearing the hurt in his voice was hurting me more. Kanrik grabbed my face and forced me to look at Khy. <font class="other">Look at him! Look at the man that took away your parents!</font> I tried my hardest to keep my eyes closed. <i>Kanrik, stop!</i> Khyome yelled. <i>What do you want?!</i> <font class="other">Come back to the Guild, my son. It's where you belong. These people took you away and now I'm taking you back.</font> I couldn't even think. What was going on?! Khy was a part of this… this… group.. of.. thieves? There's no way he was associated with them… He's not that kind of person… But… he took away my parents… It's his fault that I had to be the queen… <i>I'm not leaving Pel!</i> Khyome yelled. <font class="other">Fine, then you'll die with her!</font> Kanrik exclaimed as he raised his sword. I screamed as loud as I possibly could… Khy shot an arrow through the bars and Kanrik froze then dropped to his knees, dropping the sword. <i>Pelia! I need you to kick his sword over here. Then try to scoot your chair over here too.</i> I did what he asked. He used that sword to cut the rope binding my hands. I untied the cloth around my mouth and untied my feet from the chair. <i>Grab the keys, I can see them sticking out of his pocket.</i> I just looked at him. <i>Pelia, just do it!</i> he yelled. He had never yelled at me before… I grabbed them and handed them to him through the bars. He unlocked the cell and opened it. I don't know if he was expecting a hug or what but I couldn't move. <i>Pel…</i> he started. <b>You were the one that did this?</b> I asked, still sobbing. <i>Pel, please.. listen to me.</i> he started again. But I cut him off. I was so mad it just burst out of me. <b>No! You are banished from this kingdom!</b> As I yelled that, my heart broke. I didn't want to banish him… but I did at the same time… I was so hurt and torn and upset. My whole world just came crashing down on me. <i>Pelia…</i> he begged. I saw tears forming in his eyes. <b>Get out!</b> I yelled… Hugo came running down the stairs with another guard. They came looking for me after dealing with whatever was going on outside. <b>Hugo! Throw him out! He is no longer welcome in this kingdom!</b> I yelled to him. He just looked at me, then over to Khy, then back to me. He grabbed Khyome's arms and pulled them behind his back and escorted him up the stairs. I went with the other guard.<br><br></div>

Chapter 11: Broken
<div id="scroll">
The other guard escorted me to the royal infirmary to make sure I was completely okay. We had two in the palace. One for royals and one for the maids, servers, everyone else. I was so mad and upset… So many things were rushing through my mind. All those years of being mad at my parents for abandoning me and making me have to step up and be the queen at such an early age… and it was all actually because of Khyome. I didn't even want to speak his name really… I was so hurt and felt completely betrayed. How could be befriend me after everything he had done to me. He ruined my life. I was sitting on the bed in the infirmary, too upset to even cry. I just stared at the floor. Then I thought about all the fun times we had… and how I would have never met him if none of that ever happened… Ugh. <b>Get yourself together, Pel.</b> I whispered to myself. A few minutes later Hugo walked into the room. He bowed to me then asked how I was feeling. <b>How do you think, Hugo? I feel… broken… betrayed… embarrassed. Why did no one tell me what a monster he was?!</b> Hugo sat down beside me on the bed. <font class="other">Now Miss Pelia, do you really think he's a monster? Deep down in your heart?</font> I… I didn't know how to respond. Deep down… he was like my brother. I loved him like a brother. Like a savior. My bodyguard... <b>I guess not…</b> I replied. <b>But how am I supposed to forgive him for what he did? The entire kingdom knew about him. Everyone except for me. So everyone got to watch me make a fool out of myself making him my bodyguard instead of just banishing him from the beginning.</b> Hugo put his arm around my neck and pulled me closer to him. I wrapped my arms around him for a hug and finally broke down and started crying. <font class="other">He did save your life, Pelia. Why would he risk his own life to protect you if he didn't care about you? I had never seen you more happy than when you were together with him.</font><br><br>
Later that day I mainly just stayed in my bedroom. I still couldn't think straight. I was so mad at Khyome… but at the same time I missed him. He was my only friend. He had always been there for me. But then why didn't he freaking tell me what he did in the beginning? When we first met. Probably because he knew I was too young to handle that… and I wouldn't have fixed him up and practically saved him while he was in that cell. Oh. So he used me! …No… He's not that kind of person. Ugh! I buried my face in my pillow. After crying even more, I finally wore myself out to the point that I fell asleep. In my dream I saw Khyome. I saw us growing up together. All the good times we shared. Everything he had done for me and everything I had done for him. I couldn't let that part of my life go… A song was somewhat playing in my dream. When I woke up I hurried to my desk and started writing down what I could remember, filling in the blanks as I went along.<br><br><i>I burnt the bridge that you were building, but I left you feeling guilty that we couldn't see eye to eye.</i> <b>Why can't we compromise? Why are we choosing sides? When will we realize we don't have to fight anymore? Where is the love we had before? Wouldn't the world be better off if we decide? We don't need our pride anymore. Where is the love we had before? Where is the love? The love we had before…</b> <i>You used to be the one I'd run to, now I tend to run you right into the ground.</i> <b>Sorry I was such a fool. Never saw your point of view. Can we start over somehow…? We don't have to fight anymore. Where is the love we had before? Wouldn't the world be better off if we decide? We don't need our pride anymore. Where is the love we had before…? You know we only hurt ourselves when we don't communicate. Why can't we stop and make a change? Where is the love? Where is the love…? We don't have to fight. Where is the love we had before? Where is the love?
</b><p align="right"><font color="#61c792">The Love We Had Before - Fireflight</font></p><br>
A few days went by. I was still seriously on the fence about what to do about Khy… but that song just kept playing in my head. I needed to at least talk to him. Get his side of the story. I didn't give him a chance before to explain himself… I walked out of my room and went to look for Hugo. I found him near the front door of the palace. <b>Hey… can you do me a favor?</b> <font class="other">Of course, Miss Pelia.</font> he replied. <font class="other">What can I do for you?</font> <b>Can you send a message to Khyome? I know you probably told him a place to stay at.</b> Hugo looked a little worried. <b>Don't worry. I'm not mad. I figured you would because you're too sweet of a guy, and I'm happy you did.</b> Hugo gave me a small smile. <font class="other">I'll get right on that letter for you.</font> <b>Thank you.</b><br><br>
I went to the kitchen and rummaged through the fridge. I hadn't eaten much lately… I just had no appetite. But I figured a sandwich or something would do me some good. When I closed the fridge I saw a maid standing off to my right. She almost gave me a heart attack. I put everything down that I had gathered from the fridge onto the counter. She bowed to me. <font class="other">I'm sorry for spooking you, Miss. Would you like me to make you a meal?</font> <b>No, I can do it. I'm fine. But thank you.</b> She looked down. <font class="other">I'm also here… if you would like to talk.</font> Come to think of it, I hadn't talked with any of the maids or anyone else for that matter too much lately. I was always with Khy. I fixed up my sandwich and we sat down at the dining table and I told her the whole story about him and I. Hugo walked into the room and told me that he asked Khyome to come to the palace at 5:00 PM. As soon as he said that I could feel my adrenaline start rushing. I got really nervous and pretty sick to the stomach. Why did I have to eat just then?<br><br>
It was about 4:00 PM when I started getting ready to address Khyome. I wanted to try and relive a happier time… so I put on the same dress I wore for my coronation. My heart was in my stomach. I didn't want to see him but at the same time I did… I had so many mixed emotions. Sad, angry, hurt, excited and terrified. All at the same time. I felt like I was going to vomit. I walked into the throne room, holding my stomach. I sat down and could feel myself shaking. I couldn't stop staring at the doors in front of me. Then they opened… If I wasn't sitting I probably would've passed out. I saw Hugo walking in with Khyome who had his head down staring at the floor… he wouldn't look at me. I kind of didn't want to look at him either. Anger was filling me more and more… I just kind of wanted to be alone with him. Having everyone's eyes on me wasn't making me feel any more comfortable. <b>Clear the room.</b> I said in a stern voice. The guards and maids hesitated just making me even angrier. Do they think I'm kidding? <b>I said get out!</b> I yelled. Once they all finally left the room I told Khyome to stand up. I finally wanted to look in his eyes and see what he was feeling. But he didn't respond. <b>Khyome.</b> He finally looked up at me… I thought I was ready but apparently I wasn't. I avoided eye contact too. I looked off to the side and closed my eyes. <i>Pelia…</i> I heard him whisper. His voice was shaky. <i>Pelia… I'm so sorry. I wanted to tell you.</i> Without thinking, I stood up and yelled <b>Then why didn't you, Khyome?!</b> I started getting a lump in my throat again. <i>I wanted to tell you.</i> he started. <i>I even asked Hugo not to tell you because I wanted to do it myself. But I was waiting for the right time.</i> <b>How am I supposed to forgive you? That guy was right. I can barely even look at you because you took my parents away and forced me to be the queen!</b> He quickly responded. <i>I had no idea that was going to happen, Pelia!</i> We finally made eye contact even though it was painful… <i>I was a part of the Thieves Guild. Yes. Kanrik found me when I was a small child and he took me in. I didn't know any better!</i> He told me his whole backstory that I had never heard before… he kept it all a secret and now I understand why… <i>For my thirteenth birthday, I was eligible for a higher position in the Guild. The only way I could do that was by successfully completing a quest for Kanrik and he assigned me to steal the queen's jewel. The jewel that's sitting on top of your head right now!</i> My eyes widened. I slowly lifted my hand and touched my tiara… <i>I wasn't supposed to get rid of your parents. I was thirteen years old!</i> he exclaimed. <i>I panicked! I didn't even know they had a daughter!</i> I took a deep breath. <b>All I'm asking is why didn't you tell me?</b> <i>You were the only friend I had, Pel… You took care of me.</i> His voice when from demanding to weak and fragile again. <i>If it wasn't for you, I would've died in that prison cell. The only thing I never wanted to do was hurt you. So I kept it from you. I knew you would be crushed if you knew I was behind the whole thing…</i> I was speechless. I seriously didn't know how to respond… That lump in my throat grew and grew and tears formed in my eyes. Then he took a step closer to me. I backed up a little because I was… afraid. He stepped back down to give me space again. <i>Pelia. I'm sorry. I never wanted to hurt you. I hate this feeling. I thought I had overcame my past but it just keeps being brought up no matter what I do. I tried everything to forget about it and move on. I wanted my new life to consist of you and only you. Pelia, please. My heart aches without you.</i> He made a fist and placed it on his chest where his heart is. <i>I'm here for you… always and forever.</i> I still didn't know what to say… all I could say was his name. <b>Khyome I…</b> I was crying too much to finish. He slowly walked up to me and put his arms out, wanting a hug. I hesitated for a while. <i>Forgive me? I want nothing more than to see you happy and protect you.</i> I still just stood there but eventually I finally put my arms out and hugged him. I was still unsure and scared… I pulled away and he put his hand on my cheek. I grabbed his hand softly with mine. <b>It's going to take a while Khyome… but.. I'd like to have you back as my bodyguard. You did save me after all.</b> I managed to say. He hugged me again, very tight this time. I didn't really hug back… then he kneeled before me and said <i>It would be my honor, Miss Pelia.</i><br><br></div>

Chapter 12: Battle Scars
<div id="scroll">
Things were awkward. Very awkward. The dungeon was roped off so no one could go down there anymore. No one wanted to… I proposed to have a separate jail house outside of the kingdom. It had been a long time since Khyome and I had really talked with each other. He was just… my body guard. He treated me like any other guard would and pretty much just escorted me around everywhere. Hugo and Khyome would go visit Hugo's grandmother on occasion and since I can't be without Khyome I had to go too. She's a pretty cool lady though. I don't mind hanging out with her. She makes great tea. Khyome and Hugo were helping to fix up her house inside and out. Khy came through the front door and handed me some flowers he had picked from Gram's garden. My heart fluttered and I smiled and blushed. I tucked my hair behind my ear but then memories came back of a few months ago… and I said no thank you. Khy gave them to Gram instead and she put them in a vase. I sighed. I didn't really want to be around anyone anymore so I told Khy we were going back to the palace. I didn't want him in my room so when we got back he went into his and I went into mine to take a nap. I slept for a few hours but of course I had to have another dreadful nightmare about my kidnapping. I couldn't get it out of my head. It was a terrifying experience. Even though I know those guys are gone and aren't a threat anymore… it still scares me. I don't know how long it will take to get over that. I woke up sweating, my heart was racing. I sat up on the edge of my bed and wiped my face. I didn't want to be alone that night… Every time I fell back asleep I just drifted back into that same nightmare. I brushed my hair with my hands and tiptoed out of my room and over to Khyome's. I knocked on the door very lightly. I didn't want to wake him up if he was sleeping… I heard him in there moving around though so I knew he was awake. He just didn't answer me at first. <b>Khyome… may I come in?</b> I asked softly. I heard him say yes so I opened the door and slowly walked in. He was doing chin ups on a bar. I looked down at the ground and said <b>Khy.. I uh… want to talk to you.</b> He dropped down from the bar and toweled off. <i>Okay, then talk.</i> he said in a very… emotionless voice. <b>I... wanted to apologize.. and wanted to.. thank you.. for saving me. It was very brave.. and I'm sorry you were injured.</b> I said. I was still just staring down. It was very hard to look at him and talk to him. <i>It's fine. My leg is better now. And you're welcome. It was my job.</i> His voice still completely void of emotion. We weren't the same anymore… and it hurt me so much. I didn't even realize I was staring at his abs. <i>So you don't mind this now?</i> I didn't know how to respond so I didn't say anything. I just looked him over. I finally found words. <b>I remember the day we met. Barely. But I remember it. You look so different now.</b> <i>Yeah, I'm older and stronger now. You look different too. You're a lovely, grown young woman now.</i> I blushed and smiled a very tiny smile. I reached out and touched his chest. I ran my hand down, feeling all the scars covering him. God, he had been through so much. I ran my finger along one scar in particular. <b>Do you remember how you got all of these scars?</b> I asked. There was a small moment of silence, then he sighed. <i>Why are you over here, Pelia?</i> He didn't call me Pel anymore… I finally confessed. <b>Okay I uh.. had a nightmare.</b> <i>About Kanrik?</i> he said like he knew exactly what I was talking about. <b>Yeah…</b> I said as I sat down on his bed. I ran my hands along the covers. They were so soft. He walked over and sat down next to me. <i>I'm sorry.</i> he said. <i>You're safe now though. You have me.</i> There was more uncomfortable silence… Then he randomly said <i>Yes</i>. <b>What?</b> I said, completely confused. <i>Yes, I remember how I got all of my scars.</i><br><br>
We were up all night long pretty much. I was poking at all of his scars, asking how he got each of them while he laid down on his bed. I could tell some of them really hurt him to talk about because they were ones he got while he was in the Guild and he wanted to forget about that chapter of his life. I got to the scars on his tail when I started yawning. I was finally getting tired. I guess it was contagious and Khy started yawning too. <i>We should really get some sleep</i> Khy said and I couldn't agree more but I was worried… <b>I am pretty tired…</b> I said. <b>But I don't want to go to sleep. I don't want to have that nightmare again.</b> <i>Then sleep in my bed.</i> he replied. <i>I'll take the floor.</i> I felt kinda bad… <b>Are you sure?</b> <i>Of course.</i> I guess he really didn't mind… He got some spare pillows and blankets and put them down on the floor next to his bed. I asked to keep the light on the nightstand on and we finally managed to get some sleep. Apparently Hugo came by twice to tell us food was done but we were in a deep sleep so neither of us heard him. During the night I did wake up once and couldn't stop thinking about what had happened recently. I felt terrible about everything still… I don't think those feelings were gonna go away anytime soon. I sat up on the edge of the bed and ran my hand through my hair. I looked down at Khy who was sound asleep and figured I would be more comfortable if I was closer to him… So I slowly and quietly tucked myself in next to him and slept for pretty much the rest of the day. I remember somewhat waking up as he put his arms around me and pulled me closer. I smiled and finally felt safe and happy again. This was where I needed to be.<br><br></div>
