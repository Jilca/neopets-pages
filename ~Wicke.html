<p>The lights were beautiful the night that I left.
<br><br>I skirted across the grass, face coming in contact with countless leaves and whip-like branches. They seemed to cling to my clothes and try to hold me back. Damp, musky air protrudes my lungs in sharp inhales as I try to fight the fire in my chest. My mouth had run dry from all this panting and my limbs have become slack with all this sprinting but I could not stop. I've already made it this far.
<br><br>I frantically reached for my back pocket for the fifth time, feeling for the bump of the item I stole. <i>Still there.</i> I had to slow my pace every time I checked but my paranoia constantly got the better of me.
<br><br>I had run through this forest so many times, I could tell where I was based off the patterns of the moonlight that sifted through the treetops. But they were alien to me that night. All I knew was that if I kept going, I would get there eventually, even if I had to search through every inch of this godforsaken forest.
<br><br>My heart suddenly felt a pang, but it was not from the pain of running this long. I wondered how long it would take for someone to notice I left. I wondered who, if anyone, would miss me. And worst of al, I wondered if it was too late to go back and return the wedding ring. <i>Would I still be married off to the prince I don't love?</i>
<br><br>The thought made me trip my step and I tumbled straight into the dirt. My ankle bent at the wrong angle but I groped my pocket again before I could think about myself. I breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>　"Well this isn't the time for resting, Mariella. I'll give you a five-second head start before I come after you."
<br><br>My heart stopped and sank to the pit of my stomach at that voice. <i>It is unmistakeable.</i> I look up to see my own self, arms crossed and shaking her head at me.

<p>Wicke's character was inspired by many things. Firstly, she is named after an old friend of mine I met on here on Neopets; much of Wicke's personality is derived from her. She was mischievous, playful, and outgoing, and I had the time of my life being her friend. Part of this character is an homage to how reckless, naïve, and rebellious we were as twelve-year-olds. Also note that Wicke's last name is not the real Myra's last name, it was adopted from my previous wraith usul's character that she is also inspired by. (So please don't go searching for a Myra Martinez!)
<br><br>Secondly, I watched Disney's <i>Descendants 2</i> right before working on her story to gather the inspiration to write. You may spot similarities in Myra and Mal's personalities, and their names even coincidentally start with 'M'. However, if you expected something sappy, cute, and cheesy I hope you were pleasantly surprised. ;D
<br><br>Lastly, I have implemented attributes of a pet I used to own, Imbue, that is especially prominent in Wicke's petpet. They share the same name, Death, and both play roles in accompanying the protagonist as well as being a constant reminder of her past.
