<h1>GRAVE CRIES ECHO ON THIS SOLEMN NIGHT</h1>
<br><p>I could hear the heart of the patient drum beneath the feathered palms of my hands. His chest raced rapidly, even though he was unconscious. A bead of sweat trickled down my neck, and I was reminded of how long I was caged in the medical hut. Days, I believe, swathed in endless layers of suits and masks to decline this thriving blithe in our garden of Eden...this <i>plague</i> debilitating our meticulously crafted utopia.

</p><p><i>Another cough...</i> I eyed the nurses who stood about, twiddling their thumbs and whistling nonchalantly, and barked some orders I couldn't even understand through the panicked haze in my head. <i>...another cough, another surge of blood...</i> Bony fingers fumbled with clumsy vials of medicine. Things dropped, things toppled over, but at least these godforsaken volunteers could get things done.
</p><p></p><center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/med_extract_puntec.gif"></center>
<i>Another cough, another surge of blood, another—</i>
<p><b>He's done for,</b> I spoke evenly, and the tension in the air eased by a thousandfold.
</p><p>I applied steady pressure on the chest with the heel of my hand as this method usually resulted in a death of subdued agony. His eyes shot open, bulging, bloody, and brimming with vacancy, and the most unearthly scream tore through his throat before he slacked and fell into an eternal slumber.
</p><p>A seemingly millennial second elapsed before the bodies around me fled the hut in a hysterical fit at the realization of what was to come next.
</p><p>I produced a battered pack of matches from my front pocket, dashed the remaining one against the emery, and tossed it to the floor. It ate the scattered hairs of straw slowly and  the moment a flame touched the edge of a wooden frame it licked the hut clean within seconds. I stood in the midst of the fire, allowing the ends of my clothes and feathers scorch, wallowing in yet another of my failures.
</p><p>It was a tradition to entirely annihilate the deceased bodies of the plague. Most doctors did this to prevent further infe.ction, but it was utter nonsense; this illness has spread and seeped into our skins so deeply that we may as well have been born with it in our blood. I burned my patients to dissolve the images of their pale, wax-like faces, prune-like lips, and life-like diseases because I will spurn them. I utterly spurn failure.
</p><p>The last of the blaze burned away, and a ring of remains and smoke danced mockingly at my feet. <i>Ashes, ashes, we all fall down</i>, I thought bitterly.
</p><p><b>Dr. Sole!</b> the voice of my assistant calling jerked me from my reverie. <b>There's someone here to see you.</b>
</p><p>I didn't look up to meet Susi's; I knew her bright emerald eyes were going to pale at the sight of another <i>failure</i>. <b>Tell him I will meet him in five minutes,</b> I said flatly.
</p><p><b>Pl-please, doctor. The man requests your presence right away,</b> she had run to my side, kicking up the ruins of my <i>failure</i>. Her voice was tinged with fear, and it plunged a deep, brooding dread into the pit of my stomach.

<p>Enter, sit. While the heath fire still snaps, holding the winds at bay. How long and far have you traveled? I hear it is a grave road out there, away from civilization. Ah, yes.

<h1>INFECTED BY POISON? OR CRAFTED?</h1>
<img src="http://openneo-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/outfits/001/067/079/medium_preview.png" title="Made on DTI" style="float: right; margin-right: 10px; width: 170px;"><p>
<b>Name:</b> Franklin Leonardo Sole
<br><b>Alias:</b> the Psycho Witch Doctor
<br><b>Age:</b> 20 or so human years
<br><b>Birthday:</b> sometime in the month of ghosts and demons
<br><b>Zodiac sign:</b> Libra; <i>Just, Honest, Balanced, Perfect</i>
<br><b>Personality:</b> He is a man of honest, genuine hardwork and achievement. Being the overly-modest person that he is, he had much trouble accepting praises and awards that bombarded him ever since his childhood. Franklin truly believed he was undeserving of any acknowledgement for his success, that anything worthwhile he produced was nothing greater than a fluke. <b>If I can improve, I am not good enough. If I do not exhaust my every waking moment and effort into something, it is not good enough. If I am not the best, I am not good enough</b>—<i>that</i> was his ruthless mentality that drove him past the edge. Yet the more he achieved, the smaller the world appeared to be, until he was standing at the top, with his name virtually a blessing for the ill. Empty, unpromising winds blew at the zenith, and the white, pure clouds that embraced the sky were a masquerade at such a height; blurring everything before him as if smoke and mirrors.
<br>However, without any inclination to bask in his glory and fame, a revelation emerged in the back of his mind: <b>Being the best isn't good enough.</b>
</p><p><b>History:</b> Franklin's existence revolved around medicine and technology. He had his own home recipe to cure the flu by the age of six. He became entirely immune to poisons and toxins by the time he was a preteen. He greatly aided in the cure to cancer during his graduation of the most prestigious university of his country. Rumors label him as a prodigy of medicine, some consider him a Godsend hailed from the Heavens above....yet very few souls know the truth behind his so-called genius.
</p><p>As a child, he was very demanding and dependent on his family. He required a bedtime story from his mother every night, and only his father was allowed to cook him meals. He was particular about every small detail, such as the placement of his fork and what colored shelf was to be on each wall of his room. Mr. and Mrs. Sole played off his captious nature as <i>the mind of a potent young man</i> and bereft him of no love.
</p><p>It was when Franklin left for his first day of first grade that his parents discovered something that drove their fragile hearts past the brink: their six-year-old boy possessed drugs. Pills, unlabeled concoctions, strange powders entirely alien to them were stowed away in his dresser. Some were organized by daily intake, some by scent or colour, others scattered among each other without pattern or aim.
</p><p><b>Mother, Father...</b> Franklin stood by the doorframe, clutching the packed lunch he forgot to bring along to school, <b>An invasion of privacy is not a virtue we preach.</b> Nothing would break him down enough to apologize and explain to his parents that he was not an abuser, but an ordinary kid who simply took the extraordinary enjoyment in researching and experimenting with medicine.
</p><p>They said nothing but their silence spoke volumes. They stood solemnly still, still as statues, static as a souls.
</p><p>It was the last he had ever seen of them before they trudged out his room with heavy hearts and bewildered minds.
</p><p>That night when Franklin consumed his regular shot of poison, he scattered his medicine in various hiding places to ensure they would not be unraveled again.
</p><p></p><center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/ldm_gauze_pads.gif"></center>
<p>The next morning, Franklin woke to his room entirely pillaged. His clothes, toys, <i>experiments</i> were nowhere to be found. All that was left was his bed, sitting solemnly in the midst of a vacant room.
</p><p><b>Mother? Father?</b> he called. <b>I do not appreciate you invading my privacy yet again.</b>
</p><p>He tottered to his parents' room, building confidence and the resolve to apologize to them with every step. His focus narrowed. His steps became more absolute. <i>I. Will. Not. Back. Down.</i>
</p><p>Nothing remained, aside from the sole packet of flu medicine. Not the expensive, Victorian furniture, not his meticulously-written notebook of medicine, not his parents.
</p><p>Nothing remained but the gripping stillness and bitter sobs that he bit at the back of his throat. He saw his future in medicine crumbling agonizingly slow in the nothingness before his eyes.
</p><p>Franklin turned, abandoning the sole packet containing the foundation to the cure of a lethal, encroaching plague.

<h1>tampering with dangers tempers provokes a treacherous thorn</h1>
<p>The soft, shadowy light of predawn swept through the desert and cast a somewhat warm glow on the dampened spirits that inhabited this village. It was a magnificent sight, yet it only captured a fleeting aspect of the glory our civilization used to embody.
</p><p>The winds whipped my face and tousled my feathers. The atmosphere grew more eerie and uninviting the longer I stood before the Governor's mansion. It was said to have been a broken-down hospital that was resurrected due to its sheer size and all the mysteries it withheld. It was so old my great-grandparents were told ghost stories about it as children. <i>The creaking of the grand stairs cannot be subdued as it reflects the high-pitched screams of ghosts imbued into the very foundation of this building. Faint knocking will can always be heard on the back doors by the souls who want to return to their bodies.</i> Utter, complete nonsense.
</p><p>I had left my people to defend themselves from the plague, and goodness knows what else that apocalypse roused. Goodness knows when another child or elder will suddenly fall ill to fatal yet impetuous symptoms. Time had never been a friend of mine, her hands seemingly to always wanting to wrench themselves from their spacey prison and slap me across the face. Never again dare I be a <i>failure</i>.
</p><p>With a splintered resolve, I entered.
</p><p>The Governor allowed not a moment to absorb my surroundings as he approached from a hallway that seemed to stretch endlessly. He was a lanky, tranquil man in his late seventies but didn't look a day older than forty-five. He bore his usual pinstripe business suit and cane, and with every step on the polished tile floor, the latter struck a lonely note.
</p><p><b>Mr. Governor,</b> I spoke in a hard tone.
</p><p><b>Oh please, call me George,</b> he smiled, flashing malformed teeth that were no less crooked than his intentions. <b>To my humble abode you made haste, I see.</b>
</p><p>I matched his aloof attitude with a lazy one of my own, and helped myself to a seat on the sofa with the softest cushions. <b>I have to say, <i>George</i>, your goons left very little room for compromise.</b>
</p><p>The side of his lips twitched with what could have been perceived as anything. This man brooked no insult. <b>As the <i>Governor</i>, you see, there is little leeway for dilly-dallying. I assume you understand why you have been summoned?</b>
</p><p><b>I've no idea, Mr. Governor.</b>
</p><p><b><i>George</i>, if you'd please.</b> His left eye flickered with annoyance. <b>You see, I have a little dilemma with the medicine my herbalist appointed to me, and small signs of a certain deadly illness may be emerging.</b>
</p><p>I rose to my feet wordlessly, and started crossing to the door. The last time I worked for the Governor, I had sworn to everyone who could hold me accountable that it would be the last. I would much quicker skin my flesh, bathe in an ocean of filthy, acid rain, and gouge my eyeba.lls out with my bare hands than be associated with this crooked man ever again. <b>No.</b>
</p><p>A short, controlled sigh escaped his teeth like a breathy scream before he spoke again. <b>I thought you may come to this conclusion before even hearing me out. Goodness me, these years treating patients and yet you still have no patience for this old man. However, I do have a little<i> gift</i> that may pique your interest</b> he said, unfazed.
</p><p><b>In other words, a threat,</b> I sighed. <b>I am of no interest in this so-called <i>gift</i>.</b> I walked again, this time, more resolute, to assure myself that there is nothing in the world this wretched man could posses that would sway me.
</p><p></p><center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/broken_bag_np.gif"></center>
<p><b>Is that your final answer? Has your time in this plague, watching poor, innocent people suffer not eroded your conscience one bit?</b> He paused for a moment to watch me continue towards the exit. <b>Woe betides the day your existence becomes so solemn. Do you really wish to never see your allegedly-deceased parents again?</b>

<h1>AN ELEGY BEFITTING THIS GRAVE MORN AS THE GRAVES WE MOURN</h1>

<center><p>My mentality shatters with every toxic dose,
<br>When all I crave is crazy, I'm physically exposed.
<br>Corruption carnates chaos, buried beneath the flesh,
<br>Dissect only the skin; press the rest against my chest.

</p><p>Breeding nightmares, brooding pain, pilfering innocence from my eyes,
<br>Will they be happy or be healed if they feed off all my light?
<br>Crying madness, seethe the truth, break away with all I know,
<br>Smile, ever-knowing, I'm muted when alone.

</p><p>All I've known was how to hide, buckled on my knees,
<br>All I've eaten was my pride, feeding off my creed.
<br>Now I tread with splintered hope, curing those who cry,
<br>But now I stand to atone, I'm cast away to die.</p>

<h1>Ashes, ashes, we all eventually fall</h1>
<p>I thank you for listening with attentive ears; put them to good use while they're still clean of infec<i></i>tion. Now that I have passed to you my experience, it is time for me to pass. I have long exceeded my time and much exhausted my stay in this world. Depending on how hard you fight, you may yet be able to milk out a few more tentative drops from the spring of life.

</p><p>Now, hurry, guest, pack only your resolve and flee so that this deep-seeded plague will not lay root into you. Take these; they may suppress the symptoms of the illness but will not slow the clock of time:

Just be ready to fight with your blood on the line and to not cry over any spilled.
</p><p>Any rats that may have fed on your food or flesh will not be accounted for.
</p><p>Whether it be in this world or the next, until we meet again.
