<b><h1>Amelie "Sukala" Martinez</h1>

</b><p>♀ "Glitter. Glam. Gloss." she held her hand in the air and raised a finger with each word. Her actions were predatory; precise, anticipating fingers slowly uncurling and flicking up, erect like a cougar catching the scent of its prey. Each movement was deliberate, from the angled tilt of her head to the slow pivot of her ankle as she reclined in her chair.
</p><p>The other girls couldn't help but notice in their reflections adorning the walls, their makeup and attire were greatly paled by Sukala's. They gazed in subconscious awe as their minds drifted in wonder, curiosity, and envy. Sukala was the living embodiment of what these girls desired to achieve, and her no-less-than-perfect posture loomed over them domineeringly.
</p><p>♀ "Ladies, seduction is no less of an art than sculpting and painting. With every flick of the wrist and churn of the hip, we pioneer new forms of pleasure. We are the Van Goghs and Monets of today. The best kind of art is not only seen, but <i>felt</i>."
</p><p>Like a small wave the crowd of girls rose up, row by row, as if a proper standing ovation was a paramount technique among them, and gave a restricted but strong applause. Minimalism was key in The Slumbering Sheep. Minimal movement and minimal expression to gain maximum attention. The notion was alternately celebrated as a revolutionary prompt for the imagination and despised as an act of laziness.

<h1>Ogth ➜ Prologue</h1>
<p><i>There's a certain elegance that can be found in...destruction.</i>

</p>The vinyl player spun a twisted, backwards tune of the distorted voice of someone who, just as twisted in his mind, led a better life filled only a fraction of the room. It lifted my better sense and revived the part of my mind medicine sought—and failed—to bury. A wisp of a thought weaved through, activating old emotions and memories. I was an abandoned clock, my web-laden cogs and rust-encrusted hands delicately discovering movement again. The hands that tick to the beat of time reflect my own drumming heart, enlivened by passion, adrenaline, and thirst.

<p>Throughout my years, the most glorious ones, I encountered many boundlessly talented and potent artists, all with their own morbid brand of beauty. It appeared that we all shared some traits traced back to insanity. Traits that, during our time at the asylum, proved vital to make us a family. When the rest of the world condemned us to distasteful titles, the only way for people like us to "recover" was to find a brand of psychosis so alien to society it stretches beyond their puny spectrum of understanding. Our best instinct was resourcefulness. We used to paint, sculpt, and sketch on nearly anything when our brushes and clays were stowed away.  

</p><p>Esther was rumored for his chocolate sculptures crafted from feces. Marie excelled in stranding loose hairs into bracelets. Me, well...I bid my ideas for the rare times doctors deemed me "calm" enough to "scribble" on non-toxic crayons and dollar store notebooks. I only created masterpieces, unlike those pitiful excuses for artists who settled for common discards.

</p><p>I drew flowers. At least, they appeared to be roses and poppies to the unartful eye. They were in fact human limbs distorted so crudely, assembled in such artful abstraction, they no long resembled flesh.
</p><p>Thirteen years after my release, I stood alone in a cottage hermit to society accompanied by the occasional lost hiker and garbage-hunting raccoon. I stood in the midst of the flesh flowers that finally assumed life from mere manifestation. I sheathed my red-inked pen in a cap that slid over its long tip, gripped by a leather handle. I sharpened it regularly so that it was sharp enough to cut air itself, soothed to slumber by the sweet sound of metal against metal. It was the most unique pen of its kind, crafted by the most brilliant blacksmith in the asylum. Needless to say he was thanked in the <i>most</i> fitting way possible: with the pen plunged four inches into his stomach so that he could spend his last moments basking in the glory of his greatest masterpiece.
</p><p>After all, what masterpiece can this be if another living soul has the ability to trump it? Every craftsman I have come across has been graced with the tip of my pen, diminishing the need for ink as it is expunged from the bodies of these very canvases. And oh how very convenient and cost-efficient they are! They come in varying sizes and shapes and textures. It is as if I had the entire world at my disposal. It is as if the universe itself bid me to create works so magnificent unholy entities have no place laying their eyes on it…unless it is literal of course.
</p><p>I cast a long look around the room, the atmosphere glooming as my vision tinged with the sorrowful gaze of departure. Better a masterpiece unseen than seen by the undeserving eyes.

<h1><b><em>D</em>arren Troy</b></h1>
<p><b>Name:</b> Darren Troy
<br><b>Age:</b> 24 years
<br><b>Alias:</b> the Dealer of Doubt
<br><b>Appearance: </b>6'3 and carrying muscles honed by years of gruesome physical training, many describe Darren as an immovable structure of intimidation. His midnight blue hair often fell to his lashes, though he preferred them in a buzz cut. Unnaturally harsh yellow pupils ornamented his eyes that assumed a soft white sheen in the light, as if it allowed him to see right through people. His hooked nose complimented his chiseled jaw, that often prickled with stubble. The stocky man concealed much of himself in thick black and grey business suits, even in the heat of summer. Still, the fabric would outline the occasional pec that may appear like a concealed weapon or contraband to some, especially as he is rarely spotted carrying a suitcase or any bag.

</p><p>Though he was handsome, Darren's smile rarely saw the light. The corners of his lips only curled up before a business meeting and lasted so scarcely one would question if it was ever there if they blinked. He could have been recognized for his neck-length midnight hair, his ____ eyes, or his ____ suit, but people knew him for the smile that barely reached the surface.</p>
<p><b>Lore:</b> He was the kind of man that nobody knew, yet everybody knew about. He often won peoples' favours with the promise of repose and his signature "Don't you trust me?" smirk. He unchanging attire of expensive suits allowed him to seamlessly coalesce with the city's endless businessman. But he hadn't any intention of selling a product, no. No one without the money to hire him could never possibly fathom his duties. And those who did possess the funds to pay him would never tell of his task to living ears, for more than riches, they also held filthy secrets. Cheats, scams, murders; everyone has some morbid fetish of anguish they'd like to be vanquished.

</p><p>That was precisely his job. It is said that he practices black magic and makes his clients go insane, but many things are said about him. Many believe his tricks are literally up his sleeve, as no one has ever caught the man without his heavy suit. But very few know about his connection to the mysterious Cecilia Amielle, and they believe Darren's state-deleting abilities correlate with Cecilia's power of state-reviving. No one knew exactly where he had come from, but it was obvious where he wanted to be: elsewhere.
</p><p>He was the living embodiment of wanderlust. Truly a man of the modern century, he always coveted the newest thing. Perhaps that was why she was able to remain in Varian City for such an extended period of time. He evolved at the pace of its people and pioneered many of its trends. Yet there was one individual who sparked a rare flame in him. She wore vintage dresses, studied olden English, and inhabited the most barren street in the area. She was like a fish swimming up a waterfall: blessed by the will to climb but doomed by the inevitability of her fall. Yet she did not fall. Though he was a man who makes a living surrounded by those consumed by negativity, Darren had never heard an ill word uttered about Cecilia. But also as a man of impeccable self-discipline, he never allowed emotions to tamper with his work. Until he was provided the task to eliminate her.
