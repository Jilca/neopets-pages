<blockquote>The man doubles over, some strange cross between a choke and a scream escaping his lips as he brings his hands up to his neck. Veins flash in the light, contrasting harshly against the soft glow of the candles. Some unseen force appears to be smothering all the oxygen from the man's lungs but aside from the woman who is several feet away no one else was in sight.
<p>No one else...until you look down and see your own fingers, transparent and ghastly, squeezing his throat with all your might.

<center><br><i>Now playing: Death Parade - After the Game (Ep 10) Piano OST</i></center>
<p>...Hello. What is your name? Lovely to meet you. I am Cecilia. Apologies for the mess, it's a little difficult to detach myself from this place. It's silly, however...I have the strangest attraction to dresses.
</p><p>In any case, you may have noticed that you just strangled a man to death. You are my companion, a ghost. Your duty is to follow my potential customers and tell me about them before they come to me. And if any dirty work must be done...well, that is your duty as well.

</p><p>I suppose I owe you an explanation about my powers. 

</p><p>I wasn't sure how it happened myself. Many people have roused rumors and theories of their own, usually out of interest, sometimes to gain others' interest. Little would find amusing that the most rational stories were the furthest from the truth.
</p><p>I, in fact, know not the whole truth. Since visiting the pasts of many others I now feel a tinge of conflict whenever I speak about myself. I know not what I am constructed of, but I know who I am. Yet if who I am lies in the foundation of which I am constructed, do I truly know who I am?

</p><p>I was given this...ability. Whether it have been some accident or the will of some higher power, it changed me. And it changed everyone else. 
<br>I believe I was just a child when I first discovered it. It was in my aunt's sewing room where my brother, Adrien, and I were playing tag, running around the room filled with fabrics and unfinished dresses. I was it and I-I touched...<i>tagged</i> him and both of us fell unconscious. We might have knocked over some of the mannequins because when I woke up minutes later Adrien was nowhere to be seen and I lay unable to move in the ruins of my aunt's work. I didn't listen to her yelling at me; I couldn't. I was overcome with the strangest thing I have ever felt...
</p><p>The feeling...I'd say it feels like I'm spiritually slipping out of my body and entering someone else's. When I'm there we both lose consciousness and I have the sensation of diving underwater, as if I sink through their memories. The more I sink, the more I—<i>hic</i>—I'm sorry, it's a little traumatizing to talk about. I-I certainly should not be crying... 
</p><p>I search and look for what the person would like. I can restore anything from healthy, memories, emotions... I believe I also can completely end the life of someone with these abilities, and I believe I have come close many times.
</p><p>It's all a very—<i>hic!</i>—...It's all a very dangerous process. I get scared because when I find what the person would like me to restore, I have to take it and swim back to the surface, and sometimes—<i>hic!</i>—sometimes I almost don't make it.
</p><p>...My deepest apologies...Evelyn will take over now.</p>

<div class="text" align="center"><div class="box" align="justify"><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ue2xalv.png"><p></p><h2>Since: A Character Study</h2>
<p></p><p><b>Name:</b> Cecilia Diane Amielle
<br><b>Alias:</b> the Fortune Forger *tentative title
<br><b>Age:</b> Twenty three years
<br><b>Zodiac:</b> Pisces; compassionate, intuitive, gentle, reactive</p></center>
<p><b>History:</b> Cecilia was raised in a large family of eight children in a small town at the border of a city that taunted its neighbors with flashing lights and busy roads. She adapted her love for fabrics from her aunt, who tailored expensive wedding dresses. Every holiday her family was invited to her villa and as the adults partied she found herself in the studio, studying the frills and laces on each gown. Though her aunt hadn't specifically forbade her from entering her private work area, she always felt the inkling of trespassing whenever she snuck away from the dinner table.
</p><p>One night when she was caught her aunt had discovered her lying in the midst of her best dresses, entangled in string and cloth and beads. She wasn't sure what drove her away exactly, perhaps it was the shame, perhaps it was the panic...perhaps it was the strange revelation of entering someone else's soul that she could not shake, that planted a seed of fear in the back of her mind. 

</p><p>Over ten years later Cecilia returns to her town to find that the shop had been abandoned due to bankruptcy and most other nearby shops deserted as well. She took temporary refuge in the attic but made a home out of the small living space when she found herself unable to detach from the only thing she has left of her family. Cecilia has had the strangest attachment to dresses, even though they bring her the solemnest despair, ever since.

<br><blockquote>Those eyes. Those eyes only turned red when Cecilia was trying to see into another person's past and drawing out the bits he wished revived. The dramatization of the effort required made her appear almost saintly; the red of her pupils made her seem almost as if in pain. Her hands would burn as if she were using them to sift through the oldest cinders in Hell as she tore and plucked at the person's past—hence the gloves. 
<p>She often described going through a person's past like diving. The invisible force that blew her back like a wind often left her hair in shambles after the affair. She has since kept it short and tied with a bow that often did little to confine the strands.
</p><p>Cecilia wore the heaviest gown she could find at all times. The thick cotton was sometimes dragged by weights she would attach beneath the flow of the dress to prevent from fluttering up. The dark color of the fabric shadows most of the womanly...<i>accents</i> that she wished to cover. Besides, the maroon matched the eyes rather nicely.
</p><p>Though the necklace was rather inexpensive the emerald encased in the thick gold wires was from the blouse her aunt had thought she destroyed. She kept it as a reminder of family, and kept it close to her heart as a barricade.

<center><p></p><h2>Thane</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/mauket_ghost.gif" style="border-radius: 50em;" width="75"></p></center><blockquote>
<p>You will now be known as <i>Thane</i>, meaning an attendant warrior, a <i>follower</i>. You tail potential customers and follow their pursuits to determine whether or not their desires are worth Cecilia's time. After all, she runs quite a dangerous business.
</p><p>Not only that but you must protect her while she is unconscious, Thane. You are the reason why she can somewhat comfortably reside in one location. Chase away trespassers, elude the danger. It's simple! They're just humans after all, and there's only so much a dead body can do.
</p><p>However once an inhuman force threatens the safety of Cecilia, will you be ready?

<h2>One: Camilla Bellerose</h2></center>
<p>The lights were blinding. They came in an unrhythmic barrage of cameras that would at times pause for entire minutes, waiting for me to assume a proper position. Seven men stood before me, each capturing a different angle. They all cheered out of politeness as they took shots, but I knew each voice was tinged with lust. Their faces were hidden behind seven thousand-dollar lenses that must have cost more than their education. They were not human to me. The one man who mattered did the least of the work: he sat. And he observed.
</p><p>His displeasure came in the form of low grumbles whenever I smiled in a way that was not provocative or covered too much of my skin with my hands. The sounds usually unitized with the ceiling fan or the creak of the door and no one would know the true depth to his anger until he exploded. "All y'all knuckleheads! Stop!" His voice reverberated all throughout the studio. As if his world flicked a switch the cameras and wind machines and papers were dropped in place. "Take a 15-minute break. Everyone. ...Except you, Camilla." He raised a slow finger and hooked it, beckoning me.
</p><p>All in one breath I released, "Please, Mr. Peterson, I've been taking those diet pills you recommended and I'm getting that nose job next week and the baby's been keeping me busy but the makeup covers most of the baggy eyes and I'm certain at some angles and under bright lighting they wouldn't even be vi—" A hard foot came on to the ground and seemed to shake the entire building, though every else was either too occupied or too afraid to pay notice.
</p><p>In a softer tone than I expected, he said, "Cammie, dear, the fashion industry is a finicky one and models from around the world come and go daily. You could be on the front cover of a magazine one day and the next working in a junkyard without a name or a face. All that matters is your image and we can only alter it so much." He laid a hand on mine and slowly pulled me down so that I was kneeling before him. I raised my head to meet his gaze, not finding any other suitable place to look as he ran veiny fingers through my curls. The curls my stylist spent three hours perfecting for the photo shoot. I...
</p><center><br><a href="#adventure2"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vp2e5qG.png"> Slap his hand away.</a>
<br><a href="#adventure3"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vp2e5qG.png"> Persuade him.</a>
<br><a href="#adventure4"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vp2e5qG.png"> Say nothing.</a>

</a></div></div></div>

<br><br><br><div class="Container1"><a name="adventure2"></a><div class="text" align="center"><div class="adventure" align="justify"> <center>
<h2>Rules Breed Rebels</h2></center>
<p>I felt his nails dig in to my neck as he ran a thumb across my cheek. His fingers picked up bits of my blush and foundation. I knew he was going to berate me on how blotchy my makeup is later. My jaw tightened a notch. One moment Mr. Peterson was feeling me up and the next he was on the floor, gazing up at me with a mixture of shock and anger, his chair knocked over in the corner of the room. 
</p><p>My face was stunned in a look of indifference, and I refused to apologize for my actions as I knew even if I didn't intend to do it, I would have wanted to anyway.
</p><p>Blood rose to Mr. Peterson's cheeks and for a moment he looked like a tomato being squeezed before he exploded. "Get out! Get out of my studio and never show your face here again you wretched little—" 
</p><p>He snatched a stack of papers lying next to him and tossed them my way, intending to hit me but only managed to scatter them back on the floor. "Out! NOW!"
</p><p>My feet moved mechanically; I crossed the room quickly as if I could outrun the shame that chased me like a road. I broke out into the streets and was immediately rushed with the air of change, the revelation of a new life.
</p><p>The soft afternoon rain pelted my dress, the already-thin fabric becoming more transparent. I crossed my arms over my chest and tried to walk with dignity. I felt eyes on me as I turned a corner but the ones that truly burned were  from my friends who had come to watch the photo shoot. Shivers trickled down my spine at the realization that I hadn't a clue where I was heading. I was lost in every sense, and the sinking sensation of defeat crushed me.

<h2>More Flies are Caught with Honey than Vinegar</h2></center>
<p>A smile that seemed to have emerged from the seductiveness I did not possess played at my lips, as I cocked my head up and felt his hand slip from my hair. "Sir, surely there is something we can work out. Since you're such a man of knowledge, there's certainly something you can do for your favourite model?"
</p><p>He grinned like he buried a chest of treasure and I had found it without a map. "Well," he rubbed his chin as if he could stop now that he's started. "I do know of a certain fortune forger. Her name is Cecilia Amielle and she lives somewhere in that abandoned town near the northeast border of the city. If you can find her and persuade her to help you..." He forgot his sentence and reached his hand into his coat,producing a rather large wallet that more closely resembled a small purse. He counted the hundreds in there and handed me them all with a wink. "Nothing's more persuasive than numbers."
</p><p>I pocketed half the cash on my way out. <i>We'll have to see about that.</i>

<h2>Silence is True Wisedom's Best Reply</h2></center>
<p>He seemed to give me a look that crossed between amuse.ment and pleasure, as if I passed a test he expected me to fail. "Nothing to say? It seems you know your place well."
</p><p>Another stroke of my hair. A trace of my cheekbone. His hand traveled to my shoulder, kneading and exploring the length of my arm. The smallest shiver in my spine indicated I knew exactly which direction it was heading but I had already cast around myself a mold of submission. I couldn't escape it.
</p><p></p><center><img src="http://49.media.tumblr.com/a62d2f050820931691b23d4dceeb2da3/tumblr_nups86vAi21txt22yo1_400.gif" height="75" width="200"></center>
<p>I blinked the sleep out of my eyes. The room was dark aside from the soft glow of the candles that looked like small eyes watching my every move. The sound of rain pecking at the window soothed me into a momentary daze before being jerked to what was the horrifying reality.
</p><p>With a fat arm curled around me was Mr.Peterson, lying unconscious on three quarters of the bed. Tears welled up, a scream swelled in my throat, and my heart plummeted to my stomach but all I could manage was a barely audible whimper.
</p><p>All of a sudden my vision began to lurch and bile took the place of the scream that never escaped. I took no mind of stealth as I scrambled out the sheets, kicking my legs as if paddling a bike.
</p><p>I crawl-ran across the carpeted floor, disturbing the soft white carpet that looked like a sheet of freshly-fallen snow...pure and white until forced about.
</p><p>In what seemed to be the dead of night, I ran down the street under the harsh illumination of the streetlamps. They acted as spotlights following me, glaring down with mighty disapproval. My clothes fluttered in my hand and I felt a shirt begin to slip and all of a sudden the world spun and I was on the pavement, blood mixing with tears mixing with the rain.
</p><p>I wasn't sure how long I was there for. The buzz of a fever trickled in but I was an immovable avatar of my torment, washed out under the glow of the street.
</p><p>A foot came down before me, a child's foot I believed, and paused. Perhaps someone out on a midnight stroll with their parents and about to report their unusual finding. But the voice that emitted from the body was nothing like a child's. "Get up."
</p><p>I hadn't the strength. I only managed a croak that somewhat resembled, "No."
</p><p>."I am here to help you. My name is Cecilia Diane Amielle."
</p><p>This time I lifted my face ever so slightly, enough to see that above her ankle was just a long stretch of maroon-colored fabric. A low laugh shook me. "Since when does anyone help each other in this world anymore?"
</p><p>The foot was replaced by a hand, outstretched before my face and waiting to take my hand. "Since people start letting themselves be helped." When I said nothing, she muttered, "You are pitiful."
</p><p>She woman vanished from the spotlight of the lamp and into the darkness, a darkness that quickly consumed me like the silence I chose to pursue.

<p>At first I wasn't entirely sure if this was the right place. What appeared to have once been a lovely dress shop had since been transformed into a building foolish kids might visit on the thirty-first of October. A faded sign that read "Madame Amielle's Petites Plaisirs". <i>Small pleasures.</i> It sounded like a place my lecher of a boss would love to be.
</p><p><i>Her name is Cecilia Amielle.</i> Mr. Peterson's words reverberated unpleasantly in my head.

<p>In the low candlelight of what appeared to be an unkempt but rather quaint old attic two silhouettes could be seen. One was of a slim young woman perched on several stacked boxes that resembled a throne. I was unable to make out her facial features but even a blind man see she was beautiful. My jaw tightened. <i>I hadn't looked as beautiful as her since I was nineteen!</i> The other was man of unidentifiable age hunched in the corner, peering at the woman behind an old grandfather clock as if not wanting to be seen but waiting to be noticed.

They discover that six of her ancestors have had the same powers and lived long, extravagent lives, and a mysterious prophecy that indicates <i>The seventh in line will pervert her own time</i>. Abandoning their quest to expose Cecilia, they go to her shop and warn her of the potential dangers of her abilities. She does not heed their word but note that she has not used her abilities since establishing her brothel, therefore there is nothing to worry about.
</p><p>However the prophecy was in fact a warning against neglecting her powers, and when she discovers this, attempts to use them on herself to save her own life.
