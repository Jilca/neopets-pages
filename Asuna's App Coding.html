<br>Every time I scream out, my words...
<br><br>They disappear into space.
<br>Even the brightest stars can't possibly shine...
<br><br><br>...when the universe is so dark.
<br><br>All we can do is lay in wait
</p><p>For a day we are invited to another world
<br><br>Like bolides we plummet,
<br><br>Like fireworks we explode,

<h1>A Symphony of Destruction</h1>
<p>

</p><p></p><center>It was...a slow descend.</center>
<p>The stars flitted left and right of my periphery, pinpricks of hot, burning masses bulging and erupting. I didn't realize I was falling at that point. I simply marveled at the beauty this destruction brought upon. Flickers of images and sounds emerged in my head but were briskly shoved aside by the view. Colors I didn't know existed danced as they flew apart and conjoined with other colors. Was it even possible to fall when no gravity, direction, or bottom existed? I let myself drift, being stirred back and forth between the tides of time and space. Unseen forces drew away shards of my stardust. Shards of me. They drifted away, too. They floated about other fragments of stars, of the sky, of the world. I stared at the glistening ocean of broken stars. I didn't realize the universe was shattering at that point.

</p><p>A breathy hiss escaped my teeth in a plume of heat. It jolted me from this reverie, reminding me that I was not a pathetic ragdoll to be shoved around but a star; a child of the nebulas and a glorious ambassador of the sky. I pushed my limbs in frenzy against the current of gravity towards Earth. My focus narrowed. My movements became absolute. Yet I could not fight the very foundations of my existence.
</p><p></p><center><img src="http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/wp-content/themes/kerbal/img/bg_earth.png" width="550"></center>
<p>Forking traceries of lightning split the sky as I plummeted deeper. The weak light of my ethereal flesh flickered corposant. Water battered me from above, relentless and sluicing from the clouds that thrum with charged energy they were desperate to release. I split in every possible way as my cosmic spirit formed a mortal body.
</p><p>The sun was drop of gold in my periphery: a hot, burning mass bulging and erupting within itself. It slid nearer and nearer the sill of the world until it vanished under the horizon. Yet I knew it wouldn't grace the other side of the Earth with its presence, no. It would fall. Deep into space, plunging through the nothingness the universe has to offer until it becomes apart of the nothingness. The slow, encroaching darkness shattered its aura of warmth, safety, and invincibility.

<br><b>Zodiac Sign:</b> Virgo; balanced, just, philosophical, experimental
</p></center>
<p><b>Balanced:</b> no one truly know the validity of such a divine force dubbed as "karma", but if one can preach balance, perhaps some greater peace and equality, one that is willingly practiced, can be achieved.

</p><p><b>Just: </b>mortals will always know darkness…in the vast expanses of space, in the abandoned nodes of minds, in the very core of hearts. It comes in all different forms of discouragement, temptation, and fear. Some such<i></i>umb easier than others, crossing lines ignored until trespassed. It's hard to be just when constantly straddled between that and greedy joy.

</p><p><b>Philosophical: </b>it's difficult to live with the mentality that everything can be explained, but there is exuberance to be found in explaining them, so much so that it can make the endless search for answers worthwhile. After all, the most-praised philosophies only simplify the fact that there are many complexities to the human construction. Perhaps there are some things that cannot be done justice by words; perhaps languages lack vocabulary, but the most astounding aspect of philosophy is the possibilities that kindle our curious delight.

</p><p><b>Experimental: </b>on a journey to improvement, down the road to achievement, there must be very willing risks and sacrifices seized, and embraced. Perhaps the most difficult part of experiment is not the act of experimenting itself, but labeling failures as they are when blind satisfaction worship any and all progression.

<h1>A Symphony Among The Clouds</h1>
If above the reaches of man stretches a measureless region of space, if nothing but the dark and the cold and the lifeless envelope the Earth, where do the Gods reside? Where does the open Bible rumor the ever-elusive 'Heaven' to exist when science opened humanity's eyes to the continuum of the cosmos?

<p>Humanity may never draw a satisfactory conclusion. In fantasy, the strings of science are severed and magnificent tales are relayed of brave knights combatting beasts of otherworldly terror. Some say it is to gain the blessing of the Gods. These deities can dictate the length of their lives after all. Others pledge to sightings of the Gods themselves, who pay homage to the strongest of men, so that, in some sorts, their lineage branches further down the tree of generations.

</p><p>However in reality, we haven't the slightest fascination with the humans, how courageous or cowardly. We orchestrate unworldly tunes and feast upon meals too divine for the mortal tongue. We even roused our fair share of rumors of both fiction and fact about each other. Our holy abode rests between time and space themselves. We exist both nowhere and somewhere; partly and wholly. In reality, we haven't the slightest intervention with the humans that subsists apart from their imagination.

</p><center><p>Until now.

</p><p>We fell, too gracefully, from grace.

<h1>A God's Touch on Mortal's Land</h1>
The ground lifted from beneath my feet, tufts of grass peeling from their earthly prison and wrapping around my ankles. The sky tilted and I gazed, stunned by horror, as the blue grew deeper and the clouds grew larger. For what was a moment, but allowed enough thoughts to flit through my brain to make it feel like minutes, I was suspended in the air. An abrupt silence fell and my ears filled with the most unworldly ringing sound, a sound that formed into the collective screams of my fallen brethren.

<p>My eyes snapped open, unfocused, staring blankly at the mass of dull colours that moved as quickly as my drumming heart. The low growl of the sky was the first sound to replace the raw ringing, followed by an onslaught of pittering, pattering rain. The weather has been sporadic since our fall, the sun and sky knowing no rhyme or rhythm. They acted like teenagers whose curfews had just been lifted; glaring sunlight graced the dusk that are swallowed by a gloomy tempest during the day.
</p><p></p><center><img src="http://www.paintingwithwatercolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Wet-day-Bathurst-NSW-watercolor-painting.jpg" height="400"></center>
<p>I shifted my weight to my legs and stood with energy I didn't know I could summon. I trudged down the street, carried only by the aroma of food I wasn't sure how I'd obtain. My body slumped as if being dragged by a leaden weight, as if I hadn't fallen enough already. I lost and gain consciousness alternately, latching on to only the splintered promise of food, disgusting mortal food no less. However my stomach no longer knew appetite, only hunger.

</p><p>I bumped the broad shoulder of a businessman as I turned a corner. He seemed to start an apology before a scowl distorted his features. The wet stain where my arm met his caused an indrawn breath to escape his lips, quietly hissing "Filthy". Unsure whether it was my disinterest for humans or lack of evidence, but something compelled me against demanding that he have more respect towards a God. I was ignorant to society but not sense, after all.

</p><p>A small cafe at the end of the street proved to be the source of the delectable smell. With an effortless shove of the door, I was in.

<h1>Lus(t)amine</h1>

<p>I adore Lustamine because she reminds me so much of Lusamine, the most recent Pokemon game's lead female antagonist.
</p><p>Lusamine in name origin comes from Balsamine (German for garden balsam). Different parts of the plant are used as traditional remedies for disease and affliction which is represented by the affliction that Nihilego, an Ultra Beast, has over Lusamine and how she sees everything impure as a disease whilst under that influence.
</p><p></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hWiyDMw.png" height="275"><br><i>(Drawing by BDaves)</i></center>
<p>Ironically, Garden Balsam was used as a remedy for poison.
</p><p>When the player battles Lusamine in Ultra Space, all of her Pokémon will have an angry e<i></i>xpression. This is likely due to Nihilego venom amplifying their aggression, as such they have an aura which never vanishes until they are fainted.
</p><p>Out all the villainous team leader's, Lusamine's team has the most type variety and is the only leader whose team has no types being repeated and is the only leader to have a hp restoring / healing move on every pokemon.
</p><p>Interestingly she is the only villainous team leader's whose back story is given throughout the entirety of the game and (<i>spoiler alert</i>) the only one fully resolved at the games end given Lillie takes her back to kanto to get cured.
</p><p>I envisioned a strong female character for Lustamine. I wanted a character who possessed absolute power, a human who suffered the pain of loss, and a person who has the strength to push on.

<h1>Parting Words</h1>
<p></p><center><i>Now Playing: See You Again Wiz Khalifa & Charlie Puth // Madilyn Bailey (Acoustic Version)</i></center>
<p>Unlike most, I enjoy working backwards when it comes to a creative process. I usually envision the effect or emotions I want the audience to undergo and I build a plot, a few characters, a world based on that. Imagine how incredible it is that all this can sprout from just a human emotion, something we are all capable of feeling, such as pain or relief. Imagine how magnificent it is that the effect reflects the other way; a made-up person in a fantasy world facing a spectrum of make-believe dreams, ambitions, and failures can affect how a person feels and thinks.
</p><p>Story-telling is one of the most astounding means to express thought, provoke emotion, and offer change. Everyone possesses imagination, therefore every person, old or young, female or male, regardless of race, holds the ability to impact the world. A younger me dreamed of changing the world with her words.
</p><center><p>Words are a beautiful thing, and I leave you with mine.
