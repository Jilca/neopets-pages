The light flooding in - blinded her.

A gentle wave rose up past her ankles, then pulled back again. <br>
She slowly climbed to her feet, looking around in confusion.<br><br>
She didn't know where she was.<br><br>
Or even who she was.<br><br>
Looking up she saw something in the distance. A town, with large white buildings, all different shapes, dotted along the cliff side and looking magnificent under the bright blue sky.<br><br>

She noticed something strange clenched in her hand - a small marble of sorts. A little glass like orb, filled with a bright colorful liquid that sparkled and shimmered when the light hit it. Without much thought, she stuffed it in her pocket.<br><br>
A warm ocean breeze pushed her to her feet as she walked towards a bright blue gate that led to some stairs and snaked through little buildings decorated with potted plants. The colorful flowers and song birds made her feel at ease. <br><br>
She didn't feel any sense of danger. <br><br>
She climbed the cobble stairs and walked through narrow alley ways, passed by homes and lush gardens, seeing the panoramic view of the beautiful ocean below her at every angle. <br><br>
But something was missing. Everywhere she went, there was no sign of a single person. She began knocking on doors, but there was never an answer. <br><br>
And anxiety was sinking in.
It was like a bizarre dream.

The girl explored the island with curiosity and discovered a tower near the highest point of the rocky cliff. <br>
Inside was a garden filled with tall fruit trees and a kaleidoscope of flowers. The tower was lined with large glass windows all around the cylinder shaped room, peering out to the deep blue sea down far below. She was hungry and the fruit tasted magnificent. She decided to seek shelter here for the night.<br><br>

The girl awoke in the night - an uneasiness washed over her. Her bones ached as she rose to her feet and stepped out onto one of the balconies that surrounded the tower. Stretching her arms and yawning, she watched the waves crash on the rocks below. Suddenly, something caught her eye. Down below on one of the street ways… she saw somebody. No – it wasn't a person. It was just the figure of a person, glowing in a strange bluish gray aura… was it a ghost? Goosebumps crawled up her arms, as she observed the motionless spirit, wondering what it could be doing. It appeared to be just staring into a window of a small house down below.
Choking down her fear, the girl decided to approach the spirit, maybe it knew who she was or why she was here. She quickly returned inside the tower and ran down the stairs, snaking her way through narrow streets to where the ghost was standing. <br><br>
She was out of breath when she finally reached the spot where she sighted the spirit. But she was too late, there was nothing there now. Had she imagined it? Disappointed, she turned to the small house, cupping her hands and peering through the window glass. All she saw was darkness, some cob webs in the small corners, and what looked to be an old wooden chair fallen over on its side. Shrugging, she decided to go inside.<br><br>
The girl twisted the door handle, but nothing happened. Frustrated, she pushed with all her might against the old wooden door, which suddenly creaked and swung open. The girl was greeted by a bright light - it surrounded her.
The sound of beeping, footsteps clinking across marble floor, a muffled cough in the distance. She rubbed her eyes, was she really seeing this? Shaking, she stepped inside, closing the door behind her. She was in a hospital room, although everything felt sort of foggy and dream like. She stepped closer, wondering if this was perhaps a memory, a flashback into her past. The room smelled of hand sanitizer - it made her cough. She walked up to the first hospital bed, noting the IV tube and gently pulled at the blanket which covered the face of the victim in the bed. Surprised, she stepped back, immediately recognizing the face of the girl to be her own. Then the room suddenly grew bright, she clenched her eyes shut, then it faded to black. She opened her eyes, noticing the cobwebs and the dusty old chair that was fallen over on its side. But she also noticed something on the floor, it was shining and resembled the orb she had with her when she had first awoke on the island. "What is going on?," she thought frightened, picking up the marble and stuffing it into her pocket. Many questions circled her head. Was she sick? If that was a memory from the past then perhaps she was… dead? <br><br><i>Maybe this was the afterlife - after all. </i>

When the girl awoke this morning she had an unusual determination. She wasn't sure why, but she felt like she was in trouble, she felt like she had forgotten something very important, and she wanted to know – everything. She stared at the two marble orbs and wondered what significance they could possibly hold. They seemed meaningful, like they were the key to everything. Ever since she had that strange vision of herself in a hospital bed she felt the desperate need to escape, instead of feeling at peace here she began to feel trapped. So today she decided that she would explore the entire island, mapping everything out, maybe this way she would discover something. <br><br>
It was so quiet on the island, other than the whisper of a soft breeze and the occasional cry of a seagull - it was silent. She carried with her a bag she had found, filling it with pencils and notebook paper to take notes on everything she saw, from the species of flowers, to the direction of the wind. She also had found a small telescope, which she used to try and locate other land further out at sea, but she never spotted anything. The girl ventured down a winding path that led to a little grotto, a rocky cove where the sea seeped in with such a bright blue luminosity. Although she noticed something odd that immediately caught her attention. It was a dark circular hole on the surface of the water. Defying all laws of physics, she was drawn to the mysterious void in the center of the water. Setting down her bag, she carefully stepped out into the shallow water, ice cold as the slippery rocks tried to make her lose balance. An odd humming noise came from the black hole, and for a second, she thought this was a bad idea, before it began drawing her in like a whirlpool or sinkhole. Then – everything went black. When she opened her eyes she was under water, desperately trying to swim to the surface and yet it only seemed to be growing further and further away. Her lungs were burning for air. Was she dying? What happens if you die in the afterlife? Suddenly a voice called out to her, filling her mind with images. Then, she woke up. She was lying in the shallow water of the grotto, the black hole was gone. But those words that were strangely spoken to her, replayed in her mind as a portion of her memories began to surface. <br><br>She knew what she must do now.<br><br> The reason for her being here was finally clear.

<p>
Eso was living in a large city called Shanuinue as a normal child with a pretty normal life. Although, throughout her childhood she had always been rather sickly, doctors never quite understood the reasons behind any of her symptoms, but figured it wasn't much of a problem. When she turned 13 her health began to take a turn for the worse, suddenly simple tasks such as writing and running were becoming difficult. She began losing her balance and was nearly always fatigued, to the point where she stayed in bed all day.</p>

Puzzled, doctors came to an assumption and diagnosed her with spinocerebellar degeneration - an unusual disease where the cerebellum of the brain gradually deteriorates to the point where the victim cannot walk, speak, write, or even eat. They gave her an estimate of 2 years left to live ( at the most ).

<p>
However, doctors and earthly medical science could not possibly understand what was really happening to the body of the girl, for she had been possessed by a demon at birth. The demon dwelled and fed off her soul, causing Eso to weaken and eventually end up paralyzed with doctors scrambling for ways to treat her - finding none. </p>
<p>
As her health declined and she became permanently hospitalized, Eso began to understand that she would probably not live much longer. She had accepted her fate, but everything changed when a mysterious stranger suddenly appeared to her. It was the demon resting in her soul, which claimed to be called Rist. This demon began telling Eso about something called <font class="HC">HEAVEN'S CAGE</font>.</p>
<p>
She began by stating this:<br></p>

</p>
<center>Shocked and in disbelief, Eso continued on and decided that it was all probably all just a dream. <br>After all. <br>Demons weren't real.<p></p>
</center>
<center>Right?</center>
<p>
After the bizarre vision her health began to decline fast, her mother sat sobbing by her <br>deathbed as doctors scurried around... trying to save her. </p>

<font class="bar"> CHARING CROSS </font></p>
<p>
When she died she got pulled through to <font class="HC">CHARING CROSS</font>, a sort of in between plane that connects the human world to the afterlife ( either <font class="HC">ELYSIUM</font> - heaven, or <font class="HC">SHEOL</font> - the underworld. )</p>
<p>
But because of Heaven's Cage, instead of going to either of these afterlives, she would instead become lost in void after crossing through the Charing Cross. However, in this plane between life and death, the demon pulls her soul out and into an entirely different realm called Mugensui. It is here that she is safe from Heaven's Cage, yet because she is an <font class="HC">EARTHLY SOUL</font>, she cannot stay here for long ( the spirits here will try to send her back to the Charing Cross plane ). So in order to stay in Mugensui, she must obtain a <font class="HC">CELESTIAL BODY</font>. </p>
<p>
In order to obtain a celestial body, the demon tells her that she must enter a void, and in this void she must search for her celestial body. </p>
<p>
This is more difficult than it sounds for if she enters a void, she will lose all of her memories. Voids are different for everyone, and usually there is no coming back. So Rist gives her something, a token ( the small orb ), which will hopefully spark her memories once she reaches the void. If she can't escape the void after seven days, she will become trapped there for eternity. But if she can find her Celestial Body, she will be granted divine powers and the ability to traverse the seven planes of existence freely. And with these powers, she will now hunt to destroy the Heaven's Cage. Restoring order to the flow of earthly souls, allowing them to rest in their appropriate afterlives. </p>

This diagram depicts how every human has an earthy body and an earthly soul. Once the human dies, the soul enters the Charing Cross ( in between life &amp; death ), it's sort of like a small tunnel that connects life to the afterlife. </p>

<font class="FLOAT">

Once inside the Charing Cross, the soul is divided into a Natural soul and a Celestial body.<br>
Normally both of these would reach the after life and merge, becoming sealed away into that realm ( either Elysium or Sheol ). </p>
<p>
But because of the Heaven's Cage ( which is like a barrier or field ), the Natural Soul becomes destroyed, sending the Celestial Body into the void. <br><br>
Eso must now gain power and seek to destroy the Heaven's Cage. The beach that Eso washes up on with no memories is her void. </p>

The area is very inspired by Santorini, Greece.

<font class="bar"> THE STORY - CHAPTER 1 </font><br><br><center>
<p>
CH 1 - DYING CAME FIRST<br></p><div id="ch1">
<br><br>
The nurse with tight pulled back hair and white scrubs entered the room with her usual bright and cheery smile. She opened the curtains; glistening rays of light poured in and caused my eyes to tear up at the corners. "It's always so dark in here Eso, why don't I give you some natural light?" she hummed pleasantly, then proceeded to take my blood pressure and tend to her daily chores of asking me questions about how I was feeling. After jotting down some notes on a clipboard, she strode out of the room, shutting the door carefully behind her and leaving me alone in the white room as I was before she had entered. I hated it in this place, hospitals scare me, but here I am practically living in one---or should I say dying in one? I used to be a normal middle schooler, I had friends, or at least, I thought I did. I remember how they used to visit me at first, bringing me colorful flowers and telling me how everything would be alright, how we would all one day be able to hang out again by the beach, or go shopping together like old times. But after a while, they stopped coming, they stopped bringing me flowers and words of encouragement, practically forgetting my very existence. Sometimes I wonder if I am even existing at all? I do nothing but lay here, with only my thoughts to keep me company. At night I fear of falling asleep because I am so afraid that I might not wake up, that I might just slip into the darkness to never be heard from again. I used to never think about death when I was healthy, but now, while I'm alone with my worries and anxiety, I often wonder what will happen when I die. What will it feel like? Will it hurt? Or will it be somewhat of a calming sensation that relieves me from the constant torture of nothingness. Nothingness. It's hard to picture not being alive, will it be like before I was born? Nothing? Or will there be an afterlife, and maybe an underworld, what if after death there is only pain and suffering, what if I will be trapped there forever? Nobody's words can comfort me about dying, because they themselves have never died before, and lived to tell what happened. But who knows, maybe it will be a perfect world with no more medical bills, no more loneliness, and a place that will let me walk for the first time in years. It may seem pathetic and weak for me to think of these things, but sitting here alone in the hospital all day, teetering on the edges of life and death, it has made me wonder and imagine like never before.<br><br>
I pressed my hand down on the soft bed and tried with all of my might to lift myself up into a sitting position. It hurt, not just physically, but mentally. I have always been clumsy, never had good balance or coordination. When it came to sports, I always struggled to perform well, which usually ended in an embarrassing charade. I tripped and fell a lot, resulting in many bruises and broken bones. Also growing up adopted in a prestigious family who held high expectations made everything even worse. It was embarrassing. My other siblings were so intelligent, making good grades and playing sports, while I was struggling in academics and failed at pretty much everything. When my health took a turn for the worst, I felt as if everyone completely gave up on me. The hospital bills, the responsibility, and my lack of independence, it was all an absolute embarrassment. Every day I wake up wishing that I didn't have this disease, this pathetic disease that has ruined my life for good, leaving me to die alone right here in this empty white room. It's the worst feeling, to recall happier days in times of misery.<br><br>
Winter was here and snow was gracefully beginning to liter the earth with its fluffy flakes, bringing the cozy warmth of the holidays along with it. I loved winter, the time of the year where Christmas carols play in the stores, and stringed lights brighten up the dark sky. Tonight was a night where families would stay warm indoors, drinking hot coco, bundled up in blankets, their smiling faces illuminated by the warm glow of the fire place. It was the night of the blizzard that the forecasters had been calling for, the growling wind clawed at the windows and bended the trees. I couldn't sleep that night; instead I lied awake staring at the ceiling above me with droopy eyes. I didn't want to sleep; I was tired of sleeping, so I just laid there and watched the night slip by and the shadow of the ceiling fan prowl around the room. A sudden light would sometimes flicker across the walls when somebody walked by the golden glow flooding in through the window on the door. I couldn't hear anything, other than the tapping of shoes against the tile floor and an occasional murmur come from outside in the hallways, nothing unusual. I tried to close my eyes and picture the storm in my head, the cold air wisped around my pale arms and combed through my hair. The snowflakes gently sprinkled down and tickled my nose, beginning to blanket the cold earth below. It felt nice, refreshing, the steam from my breath flickered around before dissolving into the night sky. I opened my eyes, returning to the warmth of the dark little room, but suddenly found myself not alone as I was before. I clenched my eyes shut and waited, clearing my mind, then reopened them but found myself still staring at a stranger by the -blocked- I jumped inside and squinted to see the figure better as she took a step closer, the ray of light from the doorway glimmered off her dark hair and clothing. She was older than me; the woman with long hair pulled back, a stern face with narrow eyes, dark clothing that blended her into the shadows cloaked her thin yet tall frame. Was she a ghost? My mind panicked, sure I had sometimes mistaken dreams for reality but it's not like I had ever hallucinated before, I wasn't insane! The roaring of the wind became silent when she spoke; her voice was dry as a winter night. Her tone was shallow and lifeless as she whispered, "My name is Rist, and although you have never seen me, I am a part of your soul, a fragment that binds us eternally together," I gasped and felt a sense of fear build up inside of me. I have always dreamed of other worlds, with ghosts and spirits, dragons and monsters, but suddenly coming face to face with something not of this world made me frightened. "Eso, you are dying," the voice said bluntly. I opened my eyes wide at the statement, my hands shaking as I ripped the IV out of my arm and struggled to pull myself out of the stuffy covers. This was crazy, I was seriously going crazy. I had to be dreaming, there is no supernatural world, everyone knows that, so I must be asleep. I forced every muscle in my body to move, but my legs were still stiff, I topped over and fell crashing to the floor. My back ached, as the woman stared at me with her lifeless glare, "You and everyone around you know of this but don't want to accept the truth. You are near death, and because of this, I have awoken from my slumber," she said, as I struggled to speak, "N-no" I slowly choked out, but she didn't seem to care. I wanted to shout at this figment of imagination, stop mocking me, I know I am dying, but it hurt so much more when it's spat in your face by a stranger, especially since I have only heard those words inside of my head. "I have a path for you, if you are willing to accept it than your soul will be forever changed for eternity," she said, her eyes glimmering in the night as she turned and faced the -blocked- "Eso, you are being narrowed minded, I am here to give you a second chance at life, if you will accept," she said, and quickly my mind began to stream with questions. "W-w-why?" I stuttered, the voice laughed dryly, and then spoke, "Do you believe humans will travel to their afterlives when they pass over the Infinite Seas? Normally they do; however, a force called Heaven's Cage is blocking souls from entering the afterlife, so instead they will become lost in time and space. If you die now, this is what will happen to you, and I will also die along with your soul. But, I can save you and bring you to Mugensui. I can give you the power to destroy Heaven's Cage. Whether you believe my words or not, I refuse to die along with your pathetic ignorance," the demon said, my thoughts were reeling with questions. "The Heaven's Cage must be broken; do you wish to break it? The Heaven's Cage? If not, do you really want all of your loved ones to experience nothing but darkness instead of heavenly peace upon death?" she asked pressingly. There was a silence; I began to go over what she was saying inside my mind. If after death there will really be nothing but darkness because of this Heaven's Cage she mentioned, then it must be destroyed. Those were the words I pondered, yet I was still wrapped up in disbelief, that this was happening, that this could be real, that my life was about to change completely. "H-how?" I finally asked. "You must die first. There is a split time laps between life and death, where I can pull your soul into the realm of Mugensui," she said. My eyes widened, "H-How c-can I t-trust y-y-you?!" I exclaimed, realizing that I really had no idea who this person really was, or why I should even listen to her. "Trust me if you want, it doesn't matter in the end, we will meet again," she replied coldly, her voice trailing off into silence, and with that I found myself alone in the hospital room once again. What was Mugensui? Did this really just happen? Am I really awake? I sat there in deep thought on the cold floor, the clock ticked away for hours before I decided to call assistance from the nurse, explaining how I accidently rolled out of my bed. When the nurse left and I was all alone in the dark room with only the sound of quaking wind gliding around my head, I became angry. Angry that the demon named Rist didn't explain well and merely taunted me with curiosity, angry that I didn't ask more questions when I had the chance, angry that there could be a slight possibility that she was telling the truth.
<br><br>
The next few weeks were quiet and uneventful, each night I expected to receive another weird vision, but nothing ever appeared. As time dragged on, I began to wonder if it even happened, while it felt so real at the time, but looking back it seems absolutely impossible. I began to think things like, "Was it just a dream?" all of my thoughts seem to be clouding over and I sleep so much that I'm starting to feel sick. Starting to feel really sick. I haven't been breathing well; I didn't tell my mother or the doctors and just ignored the symptom. Each day seemed to grow longer and longer, and I did a lot of looking back on my life, realizing it was quite boring and dull. I could feel myself getting worse, sometimes I would think I couldn't breathe, my heart would beat so rapidly and I would panic, thinking this was the end. But then time kept on lifting me through its waters, and I kept on living.<br><br>
It was Christmas Eve, my family spent the day with me, bringing me presents to place under the tree in my room. When they left later that evening, and I waved goodbye with a smiling face, I realized right then that I would never see them again. That night I slept soundly, but was awoken suddenly by doctors and nurses scampering around the room. A pestering beeping noise filled my ears as I heard sobs coming from nearby. My eyes looked frantically from face to face of the doctors standing around me, each seeming to be doing something important with worried eyes. Everything looked rather glary even though there wasn't much light, the room was shining brightly, causing me to close my eyes. I felt a tender hand wrap around my own, I could hear voice but couldn't make out the words. I began breathing shallowly, slower and slower, until I was barely breathing at all. My mind began to fade; I could feel every inch of my body giving out as I exhaled my last breath and slipped into the cloak of the night. <br><br>
Suddenly I felt a surging energy pulse throughout my veins and a sickening feeling of blood being drained away from my body. The sensation made me grit my teeth and cringe; it felt as if a magnet was pulling out all of the liquid from my corpse. Then the feeling was replenished by hot water filling up my soul as my mind swirled into a state of awareness. My senses thrived; I could feel each of my muscles awaken out of a deep slumber. I realized I could move, so I strung my fingers through the thick air, which was quickly replaced by an embrace of cool water. I opened my mouth at the sudden tightness building in my chest, only to be greeted by a slosh of freezing liquid that filled my lungs and stung my throat. Panicked, I opened my eyes and felt the sting as I gaped at the vast scene of empty blue water stretching on forever in each direction. Before I even had time to think I began to feel myself being pulled, dragged down by a force below. I was sinking, struggling to swim upwards, towards a hint of glistening light that reflected across the water's surface above. My eyes wondered down below and widened at the realization that there was some sort of black hole sucking me down into its grasp. Its grip was powerful, my legs were struggling to kick as hard as possible, my arms outstretched, reaching for the surface above. Everything happened so fast, was this what death was like? So my mind focused, my only thoughts were swim, kick, fight, survive. I didn't wonder where I was, if this was real, if I was dead, I just needed to reach the surface, and live. Large bubbles escaped my mouth, the icy water flooding down my throat once again, weighing me down. My entire body ached, my lungs felt as though they were shriveling, the pressure building as I strived to escape the grip of the black hole below me. But it wasn't working; the surface was growing further away, lost within the bubbles. I wasn't going to make it. I was sinking. This was the end; I was going to drift into that hole and just like every other human, become lost in time. My mind began to slow down but there was only one word that remained in my thoughts, "Rist," I shouted repeatedly in my head, clinging on to the only one who could save me. Tears swallowed my eyes and floated inside the sea, my sight slurred and darkness began to sprout from the corners of my eyes. <br><br>
This was the end, the end of everything. Was that really it? All there was to my life?<br><br>
Suddenly I felt a rush of water brushing along my face, and what felt like a hand gripping my arm, my sight was replaced with floods of light as I gripped the hand and felt my body being pulled against the force of the black hole and lifted towards the surface above. With a loud gasp I inhaled hard, filling my needy lungs with the cleanest air I had ever tasted. I coughed out the burning water and wiped my eyes before opening them to an endless blue sky and glary light. My body was shaking, and I found that my hand was resting upon a hard surface; I realized I was sitting in the water; it was only a few feet deep. Somebody stepped forward and stood before me, but the bright light behind them caused my eyes to fuzz in and out, so instead I looked to my right and left. All that came into my sight was endless stretches of water. Suddenly I felt something touch my left hand; I stood up in horror as I found bodies of people resting in rows underneath the shallow water, as far as I could see. "What is this?!" I found myself saying, the first time I had heard my voice clearly in years. My heart raced and I began to panic, as a sudden stern hand shook my shoulder, turning my attention to the figure before me. I could see clearly now, having to look up to meet the stranger's hollow eyes, it was Rist. Standing before her now I could see many things I had never noticed before, such as the winding marking along her left arm, the crystalizing blue eyes, and the two blades she wore on her back. Am I really alive? I was in the hospital only moments ago, I died, my mother was crying, but I didn't get sucked into that hole, instead Rist pulled my body out of this ocean. And here I am, I am not dead, but not alive, and I can walk.<br><br>
- "Welcome, to Mugensui," she whispered.

Once Eso is able to awaken her Celestial Body and escape the Void on her own - she is granted divine powers. Most importantly, she can now travel throughout the Celestial Fissure with no barriers to interfere. Eso has cheated death, her soul is floating in a state of limbo - for she is still neither dead nor alive. <p>
The blade she wields has the ability to open black holes / voids inside of souls, which allows her to purify or shatter the soul completely. </p>
<p>
The blade can cut Soul Strings, this can leave permanent affects on humans such as erasing memories or manipulating them, washing away insanity or sins, sealing, and purging them.</p>
<p>
<font class="HC"> And yet this is not even her final form of Celestial Reincarnation... </font></p>
