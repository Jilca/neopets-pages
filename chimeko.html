The path leading into the forest before you seems untouched, there is an eerie lack of wildlife, and it is quiet. <i>Too</i> quiet. Something about this place is wrong. There is no sign of life anywhere, but at the same time, you sense that this forest is very much alive. The pulsing energy, like a heartbeat -- you can feel it humming in the air.</p><p>
You take an uneasy glance toward the forest. It looms above, dark and quiet. Cold sweat clings to your skin as you stare into the depths of the densely packed trees. They seem to stare back at you.</p>
<p>

You shake the disturbing thought out of your head. For some reason, you feel like you're being watched. <i>Don't be silly,</i> you tell yourself with a nervous laugh. It's dark now, much darker than you expected. The puffs of your breath in the cold resemble little clouds.</p>
<p>

Soft moonlight shifts through the leaves, illuminating the wooden arrow sign pointing towards <b>Shinoka's</b> imperial palace. Lucky for you, since your compass has been going haywire, spinning around like the useless piece of junk it is. As you make your way back towards civilization, you notice the path is shimmering underneath your feet.</p><p>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/avsvtpm.png" class="banner"></p><p>

Another wooden post appears in the distance. The sign points the city in the opposite direction -- it seems you've been walking the wrong way the entire time. Embarrassed, you turn around. At least no one was here to witness that, right? The forest branches still seem to reach out towards you, but quietly... ominously. There is still an eerie lack of sound, a loud silence that screams in your ears. The trees in the distance are slightly blurry, just a bit out-of-focus. Nothing too weird, though. You convince yourself that it's just the moonlight playing tricks of the light.</p><p>

At least, until it's gone.</p><p>

<i>Wha--</i> The sudden pitch-black darkness is disorienting, unnatural, as if someone had simply reached over and flicked off the light switch, the moonlight sucked away into a void. <i>How...?</i></p><p>

You hear a soft giggle behind you.</p><p>

You whirl on your heel. <i>Who's there?</i> you ask. <i>Please help me... I'm lost.</i></p><p>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/theRZ5s.png" style="padding: 10px 10px 10px; float: right; margin-left: 15px;">Squinting into the dark sea of trees, there's a soft blue light, nestled in the damp leaves at the roots of a tree. The light warms your cold spirit as you wander closer, enchanted by the ethereal beauty of the flickering orb. It's a comforting light. Faint murmuring voices emanate from the innocuous white-blue flame. There is a burning need festering inside your chest, a need to hear what these softly mocking voices are saying; for some reason, you feel as if these voices hold the secret to your dreams -- but it fades as you get close. Then, over there. In the darkness, perched atop a mossy pile of rocks. There's another little will-o'-wisp.</p><p>

It's almost cute.</p><p>

Running towards the teasing wisp now, you trip on tangled tree roots but cup your hands to catch the little flame. But it's gone, and instead, there's three in the distance, peeking out among dark leaves. Out of the corner of your eye, you see the wooden Shinoka signpost again, and it snaps you out of your entranced stupor. You blink. The air seems to shimmer and blur.</p><p>

Suddenly, you realize you've passed that signpost more times than you can remember.</p><p>

A beautiful girl, the prettiest you've ever seen, peeks at you from behind a tree. She peers down at you curiously. Nine white tails sway behind her, playing with a pulsing blue orb, one that's larger than the smaller flames scattered across the forest. Her eyes are a deceptively warm shade of forest green. She tilts her head as she looks at you. Her warm, warm eyes invite you in, and you find yourself mesmerized by her enchanting little gaze, falling, falling, deeper and deeper... 

</p><p>
</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UE2LLl0.png" style="margin-top: 10px;"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Kg9v6lD.png" class="banner"></center><p>

<i>Ow!</i> You hit your head on a a dark tree branch that you <i>know</i> was not there two seconds ago. Dizzy, you press your hand to your forehead. Blood. Your vision blurs; you fall backwards into a bed of dark blackened leaves. The trees reach for you again, and this time, you don't think you're imagining it -- those branches definitely look like hands.</p><p>

The beautiful girl from before is watching you from behind yet another tree, giggling with her hand covering her mouth. It's beautiful, her laughter. Like little bells and chimes. She's so precious. You <i>want</i> to make her laugh again. You <b>must</b> make her laugh again. She is so beautiful so beautiful so beautiful <i>so beautiful so beautiful so beau--</i></p><p>

A sharp pain pierces your mind like knife through butter, and you scream. You can feel your mind invaded, someone, something, is shuffling through your fears, your dreams, your loved ones, flipping through flashes of your innermost thoughts. You feel ants crawling across your skin and you see the ones you hold dear to your heart running in between the trees as you chase after them in vain and you suddenly realize <i>she's</i> doing it. You can hear her high voice laughing in your head now, bouncing in your crevices of your skull --</p><p>

<i>You're so funny!</i> she says, so happily that you almost feel it's worth it. <i>Play with me forever!</i></p><p>

You feel your consciousness slipping like sand through fingers and then, almost mercifully, the blackness takes over your feverish mind.

</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>
<b>Chimeko</b> is a mischievous nine-tailed fox who has lived in the <b>Jukai Forest</b> for as long as she can remember. Although the rest of Shinoka doesn't know it, Chimeko is the real reason why the Jukai Forest is so famously known for its lost travelers. With vivid illusions, she plays tricks and mind games with anyone who is unfortunate enough to stumble into her forest -- swapping the paths, switching landmarks, reversing the signs -- and watches gleefully as he or she staggers in circles on what is, in reality, a very straightforward road.</p><p>

Her most common tactic for luring mortals into her forest is simply using her illusions. However, when Chimeko is feeling particularly impish, she charms them with her <i>pretty face</i> and <i>sweet singsong voice,</i> sometimes even persuading humans into dancing, running, singing until their hearts burst and lungs collapse for the pure hilarity of it.</p><p>

Playful by nature, she possesses an almost obsessive thirst for entertainment. She's easily bored and insatiably curious, constantly on the lookout for cheap entertainment (humans). In many ways, she is a child -- immature, petulant, annoying, young at heart and isolated in her forest with no real opportunities for growth.</p><p>

Though Chimeko does not harbor purely malicious intent, her attitude towards humans is a condescending one, and she does not see the cruelty of her actions. She believes them to be lesser beings -- <i>cute</i> lesser beings -- much like humans can find pleasure in torturing ants. The nuances of mortal screams is like music to her. The sweating, agonized faces of humans in peril never fail to look hilarious, adorable, with the squeezed eyes, clenched fists, beads of sweat and tears... She finds nothing quite as endearing as fear.

<h2>Oh! Shiny!</h2><p>
Chimeko also has a knack for stealing and hoarding all sorts of objects. She loves anything shiny! Anyone who ventures too close to her collections is doomed, for she is <b>very</b> possessive over her things and will punish them accordingly.
</p><p>
She is also quite vain. If she finds a strain of water, a small stream, a little pond, she will spend hours trying various faces and admiring her reflection. Thus, Chimeko is easily swayed by flattery. If a human is able to keep his wits about him and shower her with the correctly worded compliments, she tends to get distracted and forget about him, preferring to marvel at her own beauty.

</p><p></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UE2LLl0.png"></center>
<h2>Appearance</h2><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vs2drfK.png" title="Maker image from Dreamselfy" style="padding: 10px 10px 10px; float: right; margin-left: 15px; width: 200px;">Chimeko is beautiful. Although she is as ancient as the forest, she is young in appearance and at heart. Her body is small and slim. Her eyes are <b>forest green,</b> whereas her hair is a silvery white with one dark streak. She can take on a human form or a fox form, but keeps her fox ears and nine white tails in both. Generally, she prefers her human form -- it's much easier to play with humans as a human herself! As a human, she prefers green clothing to match the color of nature. In her fox form, she resembles a small white nine-tailed xweetok, though her eyes retain the same devious gleam.</p><p>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/44tR0In.png" title="Maker image from はなむぐり at Picrew" style="width: 242px; padding: 10px 10px 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; float: left; margin-left: -100px;">She is never seen without her orb, a wispy blue-ish white ball of energy that serves as the focus of her magic. Without her orb, it would be much more difficult to wiggle into the minds of humans. She also likes to use her orb to light up the dark forest when she wants to see her various trinkets shine. The glow it gives off is muted, but mysteriously beautiful.</p><p>

Although her orb is made of her life essence, it seems to have a mind of its own at times. Normally it simply levitates nearby, but occasionally it will dance around her tails and split into swirling mini-orbs to play (or disorient lost travelers). Sometimes, when the orb comes back together, these smaller orbs are accidentally left behind, sparking the will-o-wisp tales across the land.</p><p>
