<p>　"Well, well, well. What do we have here? You look like a fresh catch.
</p><p>　"Listen here, you. I don't give a damn where you came from or what your business is. A lot of ya outside folks have been washin' up on our shores left 'n right and we don't know what to do with ya. Of course the Grimsby way would be to throw ya back into the ocean and leave yer fate up to the sharks, but the mayor has kindly offered all lost folk a refuge in the inns. Now hustle your little booty there."
</p><p>Baffled, you say nothing. The cold waters have already chilled you to the bone and you were still soaking in the surroundings. You were never one to take orders anyway, but you let the man grab your arm after a displeased grunt and drag you away.
</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yx2PpjC.png" width="120"><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2Ry28j7.png?1=" width="650"></p><p>The innkeeper is a young girl, about the age of the other girls you just passed, who already had husbands and were nursing their second child. She was fiddling around with some papers, only partially paying attention to her actions. At her carefree attitude, you could already determine she had not experienced the adulthood those other girls have. At the sight of your entrance, she smiles warmly, "Welcome!"
</p><p>Both you and the man, whose grip was still around your wrist, raise your eyebrows. "Pardon me, but how do you know my name?" you asked quizzically.
</p><p>　"Your visit has been long-awaited. There is a tragic tale of a man who once lived here and it has been waiting to fall in your ears." Her ex<i></i>pression suddenly darkened as she crossed the room towards you. "I'm Evelyn, and this the story of Varun Sterling, the man who k<i></i>illed our king hundreds of years ago. I will tell you his character, story, and about this world that you are in.
</p><p>　"Please, take a seat and I will brew you some tea. Listen well so that my thoughts, process, and ideas are clear to you. If you must take a break in the story, do pause at a lotus symbol (<img src="http://i.imgur.com/7WCdTfm.png" height="20">). It is the symbol of purity, faith, and eternity. It will ensure that your head is clear and your mind is open once you come back to finish the tale. But be warned, once you learn about this place, you may never be able to leave."

<p>　"Mother," I had said, "most all the boys in my school are Jedreks."
</p><p>Her lips curled ever so slightly into a smile as she looked down on me, her hands wrapped lovingly around my fingers, which were all thoroughly bruised and scra<i></i>ped. "Yes dear, Jedrek is a beautiful name."
</p><p>　"Why not me, mother? Why was I not given that name?"
</p><p>A small stream of air escaped her nose, and a glint of sadness flashed in her deep, green eyes. "Because your father and I chose Varun. A beautiful name you possess as well, child. It means 'infinite'. Men strive to be husbands, warriors, kings...and they sell themselves short. Why must we sprout wings simply to fly to the ceiling? Why can we not reach for infinity?"
</p><p>　"Mother, it is because of this name that—"
</p><p>She shook her head. "Yes, my dear, the boys sometimes poke fun at you. But our family has no intention of raising a man of war, and naming a child after the king will not make him any more brave, or intelligent, or agile."
</p><p>Tears had begun to well up. I could not wipe them with my hands so I turned my face so that my hair, which was long overdue for a cut, would hide my pitiful eyes. "They do more than poke fun at me, mother. They've poked daggers into my hands." At this she said nothing. "I beg of you mother, let me be named Jedrek for a day. I want to be like all my friends."
</p><p>After a dreadful pause and evident pain in her ex<i></i>pression, mother finally spoke. "I consent, Varun. But remember that being a Jedrek also means you will be like all your enemies."
</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yx2PpjC.png" width="120"></center>
<p>That occurred the night of the great rebellion. The rebels had been hidden among us for years, in our schools, in our shops, and even in our very homes.
</p><p>I kil<i></i>led my own brother in the name of the king. I told myself I had to do it even though—no...<i>because</i> I did not share King Jedrek's name. I did not enlist myself in the war, so this was the one favour I ever did for the man who tried to make his country great.
</p><p>Mother refused to let me in the house after the war. She did not speak to me, she did not look me in the eye. I had not told her about what I had done but I suspect someone else had. Surely she wasn't just acting out of shock that one of her very own children died. ...No, she was not. If she had, she would not have shoved her only other child away.
</p><p>The night I left home I was certain I was going to die. The wounds from battle had become infected and I was sat underneath a tree in the midst of nowhere. I was thankful for the storm that had been pouring for almost the entire day. The cold water helped soothe my rampant fever, and there was something about rain that calmed me. I was sat there, beneath the tree where I had taken my brother's life, waiting for death myself.

<center><i>358 years later...</i></center>
<center><p>I no longer have a name. I am no Jedrek, but I was not the Varun my mother and father had hoped I would become.

</p><p>Mother did not wish me to walk a road molded by chestplates and helms and shields. Father did not want my arm to grow a metre and call that extension a sword. But neither had suspected I would live a life pervaded with endless secrecy, crime, and death.
</p><p>Emptiness became the only infinity I knew.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uKRDFNL.png"><p><b>Clean:</b> Meticulous as the practice is rewarding, Varun never leaves his office any less tidy than it was when he walked in. Everything from his files to his clothes is precisely folded stored in one of his many cabinets, drawers, or boxes. Even spiders seldom find a habitable corner to occupy due to his weekly cleaning routine.
</p><p><b>Mean:</b> It is never really intentional, but Varun constantly repeats to himself the mantra <i>better to be a judge than a joker</i> and lives by that always. People have begun to avoid him as best as possible and sometimes wonder if a snide comment will pass his lips every time he parts them.
</p><p><b>Reserved:</b> As a child, he has become accustomed to not ask many questions. He was always too curious, or always offended someone with his ignorance. As a result, he is now quiet, but deductive, and has learned to answer his own riddles.
</p><p><b>Leader:</b> Varun has always been the type to take charge. He knows that whenever someone must step up in a tight situation, he is as good as any other candidate and there is no time to waste drawing straws or calling out.
</p><p><b>Outgoing:</b> Varun always speaks without doubting his words for a moment, and can strike up a conversation with the most introverted of people. He is friendly initially to most, but the more he talks to someone the more tired of them he grows, and he has never been afraid to show it.
</p><p><b>Impulsive:</b> Varun's gut feeling was the only thing he could truly rely on. He would take any action if it 'felt right' and can immediately detect any lie or ulterior motive as if he could sense a person's aura. Though sometimes his feelings steer him wrong, Varun is not the type to apologize for his rashness and accepts that what's done is done.

<i>(Varun — present)</i></center>
<p></p>I fell on the night of perfectest silence.</center>

It was almost comical what had happened. I had the mayor backed into the corner of his office. A fully-loaded gun in my hand and the barrel I pointed at his temple, which was beaded in cold sweat. Our gazes had been locked for a long moment: my harsh, unfeeling eyes peered into his wide, teary eyes. He had been blinking persistently, trying to hold down the tears but it was a feeble attempt.
<p>　"Please...just tell me what you want. I'll give it to you!" his voice was barely audible.
</p><p>I gave him a long, emotionless stare before I responded, "I want King Jedrek IV back."
</p><p>Hearing my reply made the last glint of hope vanish from his jet-black eyes, and seeing his defeated face was too satisfying.
</p><p>Though it combatted the virtue in my heart to do so, I shut my eyes and breathed in the moment. If I inhaled just enough I could almost smell the fear and dread in the air. I wanted to savour the victory of another mission complete.
</p><p>That moment was all it took before I put my finger back on the trigger that the building began to shake and the ceiling rained dandruff. The floor beneath me became no more, and the walls started caving in. My arms desperately tried to find something to hold, and I shot my gun in the midst of the pandemonium. A pained cry came from the mayor, and I turned to see that the bullet had gone through his left leg. More importantly, he was halfway out the window, mounting a ladder that led to a helicopter.
</p><p>I did not even have time to yell, and my weapon had slipped from my hand since I shot it. The noise from the gun combined with the rumbling of the collapsing building added with my own refusal to believe what was happening froze me. I allowed myself to fall from this floor to the one beneath, and the one beneath, and the one beneath...
</p><p>Pure silence filled my head as my mind shut down except for that one small voice that said, "Your virtue has failed you."

<p>Grimsby was once a small town accompanied by nothing but the mellow waves of the ocean and the crisp scent of seawater every fishing season. It was established by the most ardent of fishers, a young couple whose names are long forgotten but existence was hailed as if they were gods. They had begun with a modest wooden home and passed it to their children along with their spirit for fishing and swimming. As a tribute to their parents, the kids gathered other people from neighbouring towns to civilizations across the ocean to live with them by the beautiful waters.
</p><p>Soon one house became many, and everyone spent night and day by the waves and learning the ways of the fish.
</p><p>One day, the townspeople began to go missing. At first it was a mass of miscarriages, then the fathers disappeared, followed by the mothers. Only the children were left to feed themselves for a period but one by one, they vanished too. Many legends say that life under the sea was too alluring and everyone left to live as fish, but everyone knows the truth has faded with it.
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/54BNejY.jpg" width="650"></p>
<p>Several hundreds of years later, the town was rediscovered by a king and his men who were on their path to war. The king, finding it odd yet convenient that he had stumbled across an abandoned town, ordered his soldiers to rest there for the night. Every home was still in upkept condition, and each bed was surprisingly warm as though someone had just slept in it.
</p><p>The next morning everyone awoke to sudden quakes and cries of battle. The enemy had discovered their resting spot and sieged the location. Roofs were set aflame, boats were torn apart, and bloody corpses and ashes polluted the clear ocean.
</p><p>By the end of the battle, through the king's sheer bravery and strength, he led his men to victory. Though his army had dwindled, the king sent what little men he had left to gather their wives from their hometown to start families here. To commemorate this hard-won battle, the ruler ordered his men to reconstruct the houses and clean up the shores. Before too long the town was once again bustling with people, but some say the spirits of the fish people were not happy with this new colonization. They fed thoughts and rumours to the civilians that their ruler was corrupt and greedy, and thus began the great rebellion against King Jedrek.

<p>It was a hard reality to take. Many fictional characters I've read in books who have been granted eternal life had spent their time earning money, learning languages, and wishing they were mortal. I was never consumed by such things. The day I found out I would never die my goal became clear: I wanted to teach myself virtue.
</p><p>I wanted to learn to forgive my brother for secretly being a rebel of our beloved king. I wished I could forgive myself for k<i></i>illing him with my bare hands. I wanted more than anything to understand how my mother was able to lock me out the house and watch me walk away.
</p><p>There was a  pandemonium in my head the night I left home. I had questioned everything that I was and all that I knew. I had forgotten the virtue my parents have tried to teach me all my life, and I could think about was how I threw it all away the moment I took my brother's.
</p><p>My name did not ring to me as 'infinite'. I felt small, and feeble, and very, very mortal.
