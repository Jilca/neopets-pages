<img src="http://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/d5/0b/34/d50b342b474eed7b7be10769bbf5e8bb.jpg" style="float: left; margin-left: 5px; width: 170px;"><p><b>Name:</b> Darren Troy
</p><p><b>Age:</b> 24 years
</p><p><b>Alias:</b> the Dealer of Doubt
</p><p><b>Appearance: </b>6'3 and carrying muscles honed by years of gruesome physical training, many describe Darren as an immovable structure of intimidation. His midnight blue hair often fell to his lashes, though he preferred them in a buzz cut. Unnaturally harsh yellow pupils ornamented his eyes that assumed a soft white sheen in the light, as if it allowed him to see right through people. His hooked nose complimented his chiseled jaw, that often prickled with stubble. The stocky man concealed much of himself in thick black and grey business suits, even in the heat of summer. Still, the fabric would outline the occasional pec that may appear like a concealed weapon or contraband to some, especially as he is rarely spotted carrying a suitcase or any bag.

</p><p>Though he was handsome, Darren's smile rarely saw the light. The corners of his lips only curled up before a business meeting and lasted so scarcely one would question if it was ever there if they blinked. He could have been recognized for his neck-length midnight hair, his ____ eyes, or his ____ suit, but people knew him for the smile that barely reached the surface.</p>
<p><b>Lore:</b> He was the kind of man that nobody knew, yet everybody knew about. He often won peoples' favours with the promise of repose and his signature "Don't you trust me?" smirk. He unchanging attire of expensive suits allowed him to seamlessly coalesce with the city's endless businessman. But he hadn't any intention of selling a product, no. No one without the money to hire him could never possibly fathom his duties. And those who did possess the funds to pay him would never tell of his task to living ears, for more than riches, they also held filthy secrets. Cheats, scams, murders; everyone has some morbid fetish of anguish they'd like to be vanquished.

</p><p>That was precisely his job. It is said that he practices black magic and makes his clients go insane, but many things are said about him. Many believe his tricks are literally up his sleeve, as no one has ever caught the man without his heavy suit. But very few know about his connection to the mysterious Cecilia Amielle, and they believe Darren's state-deleting abilities correlate with Cecilia's power of state-reviving. No one knew exactly where he had come from, but it was obvious where he wanted to be: elsewhere.
</p><p>He was the living embodiment of wanderlust. Truly a man of the modern century, he always coveted the newest thing. Perhaps that was why she was able to remain in Varian City for such an extended period of time. He evolved at the pace of its people and pioneered many of its trends. Yet there was one individual who sparked a rare flame in him. She wore vintage dresses, studied olden English, and inhabited the most barren street in the area. She was like a fish swimming up a waterfall: blessed by the will to climb but doomed by the inevitability of her fall. Yet she did not fall. Though he was a man who makes a living surrounded by those consumed by negativity, Darren had never heard an ill word uttered about Cecilia. But also as a man of impeccable self-discipline, he never allowed emotions to tamper with his work. Until he was provided the task to eliminate her.

<h2><em>V</em>arian City</h2>
<p>At first glance one would perceive this city to be nothing more than a simple tourist attraction. It was famous for the celebrities it established, the malls it homed, and architectural advancements it made. It was the smallest city in ____ but highly populated, and due to this, many become intimidated and choose to learn of its wonders through text and tales. Darren knew better than anyone how inaccurate rumors can be. If the city were a….
</p><h2><em>A</em>ct 1 Scene 1</h2>
<p><i>Lights up. Enter Darren and Cecilia in Cecilia's living room.</i>

</p><p><b>Darren: </b> Quite a pleasure to meet you, Madame Amielle.
<br><b>Cecilia: </b> Oh monsieur, the pleasure is all mine. It's not every day I welcome a bodyguard into my home. Tea or coffee?
<br><b>Darren:</b>  Water, please.
<br><b>Cecilia: </b> (Raises eyebrow) Ice?
<br><b>Darren:</b>  No, thank you.
<br><b>Cecilia: </b> (Places glass of water before Darren)
<br><b>Darren:</b>  You find my choice of beverage odd?
<br><b>Cecilia: </b> Mais, non. (Darren raises his eyebrow) But I don't find it normal.
<br><b>Darren: </b> I'll need my voice to yell if someone breaks in and tries to kidnap you.*
<br><b>Cecilia: </b> Surely such a big, strong man like you can take care of petite moi on your own?
<br><b>Darren:</b>  Your house is so large I may not even get to you on time. (Picks up glass)
<br><b>Cecilia: </b> I suppose the best way to kidnap someone is to slip something in his drink. (Sips from cup)
<br><b>Darren: </b> (Pauses for a second before taking a large drink of water) Doubtful.
<br><b>Cecilia: </b> Daring.
<br><b>Darren: </b> It's my middle name, Madame Amielle.
<br><b>Cecilia: </b> Please, call me Cecilia.
<br><b>Darren: </b> Cecilia, tell me more about the man you mentioned over the phone.
<br><b>Cecilia: </b> I know nothing more than what I've already told you. In fact, I know almost nothing at all about him.
<br><b>Darren: </b> You know his name.
<br><b>Cecilia: </b> Yes, I've known Caleb since high school. He was best friends with my sister but never once spoke a word to me until last week.
<br><b>Darren: </b> Were you close with your sister?
<br><b>Cecilia: </b> Of course, and we're still rather close today.
<br><b>Darren: </b> And being so close with her, you've never had interaction with her friends?
<br><b>Cecilia: </b> I knew all her friends. I knew their names, I had their cell phone numbers, and we sometimes studied together.
<br><b>Darren: </b> But never Caleb Grayson?
<br><b>Cecilia: </b> Non.
<br><b>Darren: </b> You never found that odd?
<br><b>Cecilia: </b> Many things are odd, Monsieur Troy, but if I were to an<i></i>alyze them all, I'd spend more time thinking than breathing!
<br><b>Darren: </b> Why do you think, then, he would want to k<b></b>ll you?
<br><b>Cecilia: </b> Parce-que, he said—
<br><b>Abella: </b> (Calling out) Sister, I'm home!
<br><b>Cecilia:</b>  (Stands up and exits the living room) Abella, allow me to help you with the groceries.
(Cecilia and Abella put the groceries on the kitchen floor)
<br><b>Abella: </b> Thank you Ce—hello, who is this?
<br><b>Cecilia: </b> Soeur, please, this is my bodyguard. Monsieur Darren Troy.
<br><b>Abella:</b>  Lovely to meet you, Mr. Troy. (Holds out left hand)
<br><b>Darren:</b>  (Shakes hand) A pleasure, Miss Amielle.
<br><b>Abella: </b> Please, Bella is fine.
<br><b>Darren:</b>  (A nod) Bella.
<br><b>Abella: </b> (To Cecilia) He will be staying with us for a while, yes?
<br><b>Cecilia:</b>  Oui.
<br><b>Abella:</b> Perfect. Darren, I will show you around. (Begins to lead Darren up the stairs) Sister, I bought your favourite coffee and left it on the kitchen counter. Drink it before it gets cold.
</p><p>(Exit Abella and Darren)
</p><p>(Cecilia heads into the kitchen and takes a sip from the coffee cup. She falls over.)
