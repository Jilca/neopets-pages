For over 4000 years the people of Xi'an have been united by the cycles of the moon. Every family sweeps the floors, washes the windows, and wipes their tatami beds to cleanse their house of ill fortune. The doors and windows are ornated with red <i>chuāng huā</i>, paper-cuts, and <i>duìlián</i>, couplets, that signify longevity and happiness. Red envelopes are tucked under the pillows of children and fireworks decorate the constellations in the sky as everyone celebrates the coming of a new year.<br><br>

However we, the Longs, take no part in these festivities. We are a small family of nobility, the cousins, albeit illegitimate, of the emperor. Though our faces were never painted on his family portraits and our names are only mentioned in scarce whispers in his castle, we are treated just as well as his brothers and sisters. Our home is located outside of town, camouflaged in the false comforts of a thick forest.<br><br>

Our discord with society lay not in our immense poverty, the odd accent our tongues carry, or even in that most of us, although royalty, have the manners of street urchins. Those are all trivial matters that mattered not to the people of Xi'an. Though rough, we are not rude, and though we have an accent, we are simply unique, and although poor we have no interest in pursuing materialistic things. However, we never did turn down a gift. Some may believe we pawn our presents from the emperor every New Year but those are the same people who find the act more important than the thought and believe being the minority is homonymous to being outcasts...no, we Longs would never ever put a price tag on kindness.<br><br>

What truly made us different was that on the winter solstice before every lunar festival our skin grows scales, our eyes assume an unearthly gleam, and we soar to the skies with the elegance and ferocity of dragons.
<br><br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NqTre6P.png" height="75"></center><br><br><br><br>The lores my family's scrolls replay all share one common motif: the <i>nián shòu</i>, Nian. It is a ravenous beast that dominated both the sea and land. Every spring it emerged from hiding and rampaged nearby villages, devouring every living thing in its sight, predominately children. Before the villages were deserted, an old traveler appeared and declared he would claim vengeance on the monster. Though the townspeople viewed him as insane, their stares were also tinged with curiosity and awe. The night they took refuge from the village the old man decorated the houses with red paper and set fireworks to the sky. The next morning the villagers returned to find their homes and land undamaged, and hailed the man as a deity. In fact, the Nian was terrified of the colour red and despised loud noises. Thus, the villagers adopted these activities every spring and never heard of the beast again.
<br><br>However, it has been rumored that the Nian still waits for the day when no colour decorates the town and the world is at silence so that it can raise its down mayhem and paint the walls with its own brand of red.

<br><br><center><img src="http://officialpetsociety.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/golden-dragon-lantern.png" height="100"></center><br><br><br>It happened on the 24th of December.
<br><br>Our province was alive with the news of an incoming civil war. The people of Waihai, enslaved by the Nationalist government, demanded independence from our country to preach their own cultures and histories. It was the first time our nation's veil of unity has been shattered, and everyone, even the children, was abuzz with the notion.
<br><br>A small group of us huddled around two of the Hi'yan boys, Chao and Chou, aged 14 and 16 respectively. They circled each other and though there was an age difference, they were of the same height and ferocity. One lunged at the other, the younger one who lunged I believe, and soon they sprawled in a tangle of limbs sloppily striking in the general direction of the opponent. One portion of the audience dubbed Chao as the Nationalist representative based on his stronger religion passion and cheered him on. Another chanted Chou's name in the name of Communists due to his more technical mentality. The rest of us hollered intelligible sounds because we simply hungered for action. In the end, the two brothers took each other out and both lay in semi-conscious mangles.
<br><br>There was a moment of unified silence before everyone broke into applause and yells to commemorate the fierce battle. The celebration died down as Mr. Hi'yan shoved into our kids-only circle, dressed in his old military uniform that he'd only wear for special occasions, and tugged each son by his ear. "What are you two doing? If you want to fight, sign up for the army! Kicking and grabbing is for little boys, not men!"
<br><br>The crowd suppressed a collective giggle as we witnessed the Hi'yans walk away. "Those two never last long anyway," a voice to my left said. Someone to my right agreed, "Yes but it's always fun watching two dogs trying to prove which one is alpha when they'll both get eaten anyway!"
<br><br>Only a small cluster of the group laughed at that. Without spotting the source of the joke, I knew exactly who it had come from. Not many people in Xi'an cared about wealth or social status, and even fewer would insult someone for his, but Fu Zheng did both. I recalled how his family toiled for years without a home, making cents a day and eventually thousands an hour; I was about to sneer at his immaturity before I thought about how he'd use his brutal past as an excuse to harass people now. Those thoughts and a hundred ways to hurt him flitted through my mind as he crossed the circle from his group of rich friends to me and my poor ones.
<center><br><br><b>Now Playing: Just Like Fire by P!NK</b>
<br><img src="http://gallery.yopriceville.com/var/albums/Free-Clipart-Pictures/Music-PNG/Transparent_Colorful_Notes_PNG_Clipart_Picture.png?m=1430220711" height="50"></center>
<br><br>He paused before my sister, Bai, and though she was older than both of us, he towered over her by inches that never seemed so immense until then. "But of course other dogs wouldn't find that funny. I suppose the rumours are true; the only thing they take joy in is stealing from others, especially family."
<br><br>I knew Bai's arm was going to twitch the moment Fu stepped before her; a telltale sign she was angry. I squeezed her hand in mine but it was too late. He knew he'd hit a nerve. With a challenging smile he continued, "I'm a straightforward guy, unlike some people, so let me just cut to the chase: fight me."
<br><br>He silenced the entire audience with that declaration. I was about to lunge on Bai like Chao did his brother to stop her from trying to tear Fu's insides out, but something much scarier happened: a few octaves too high, Bai gave a curt laugh. "Pardon me, <i>sir</i>, but if I am nothing but a lowly dog, what business would you have combatting me?"
<br><br>Always quick with comebacks, Fu raised a brow in amuse<i></i>ment and responded, "There are two forms of violence in the world: one to harm, and one to teach. I will show you which one is truly stronger."
<br><br>A moment hung in the air, as if the air held its own breath. Fu was the military head's son, and was introduced to martial arts and kendo as a young boy. On the other hand, my family held the advantage of heightened dragon strength and speed. No one wanted to see this fight happen, but we all secretly hoped it would nonetheless.
<br><br>With a momentous step forward, I released Bai's hand. I declared, "Sister, I will take on this wángbādàn." This <i>son of a virtueless mother</i>. I flicked my braid from my shoulder and let it fall to my back and she understood. It was a telltale sign <i>I</i> was angered; if Bai's laugh was to be feared, I was to be fled from.
<br><br>Something above Fu's temple bulged as he clenched his teeth, and he matched my advancement with a long stride backward. With a jerk of his wrist, his best friend, a boy thrice my size whose name escaped me in that moment of excitement and terror, stepped forward and met my gaze with a reckless, mindless look of his own. Fu smirked pridefully, "I'm fighting a dragon. Not a dragonite. You two enjoy yourselves."

<br><b>One: Kindled Claws</b>
<br>Xue bends her fingers and flattens her palm to form a dragon claw to grab, pull, and lock her opponent. She attacks him with her palms, enabling control on the soft/hard strikes. When he strikes back, Xue allows herself to fall and uses her rear leg like a tail of the dragon to sweep the enemy to the ground.</span></div>

<div class="sneeze"><span>
<center><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/p2uQeOx.png"></center>
<br><b>Two: Dragon Steps</b>
<br>Mimicking the movement of the dragon, Zue walks in a zig-zag motion. It allows her to use floating and sinking movements effectively, enabling control on power and stability. She constantly advances, the angle of her movements forcing the opponent to reposition his entire body to defend, and throws him off balance. </span></div>

<div class="wheeze"><span>
<center><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mpwb1Ge.png"></center>
<br><b>Three: ???</b>
<br>Xue hardens her forearms, using her full fist and arms to land an unstoppable barrage of hits. She begins soft and steady, then explodes into an onslaught of powerful bursts, striking her opponent's stomach and knocking out the air in his lungs. She uses her upper body to both attack and block.</span></div>

<div class="sneeze"><span>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PC4g3Jy.png"></center>
<br><b>Four: ???</b>

<br><br>He went down with hardly a fight. All 250 pounds of the boy hit the pavement unconscious after a swift combination of dragon steps and kindled claws In truth, only I was unsurprised by the victory. Through a cloud of thin dust, dozens of eyes lay heavily on me. And everyone dispersed in all directions, screaming "Dragon".

<br><br>Only Bai remained at my side, clutching my hand just as I held hers. It was not to keep me calm, but alert. A slow applause in rhythm to heavy footfalls on the parting dust approached. His steps did not rose the dust however; they rose and parted like servants making way for an illustrious king.

<br><br>."Xue Long, Bai Long. It is my great pleasure to finally see the daughters of the famous Bing Long, <i>ice dragon</i>, in the flesh." His words came in short, strained bursts like the water from a rusty pump.

<br><br>The man was of the same height as Bai but he carried an air of suffocating intensity and though his age eroded his features, the glint in his eye promised both power and intimidation. There was nothing sinister in his expression but the sedate and practiced motion of his advancement and the stretched almost-smile on his lips sent a chill along my back like a gnarled finger slowly tracing up my spine.
