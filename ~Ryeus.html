<h1>I. AWAKENING</h1>
<p>Even as I dreamt, their brilliance shattered my vision into a million twinkling lights.
</p>
<p>The stars; they were the last thing I saw, and the first thing I saw, and everything in between. There was no escape. But I wanted none, for in the stars I saw hope, and glory, and everything I'd wanted, everything I ever would want.
</p>
<p>They felt so cold, and far away.
</p>
<p>I clung to them as to the beacon of a lighthouse. I was lost at sea, unable to escape the waves of terror and confusion; the sense of loss I felt, the sense of <i>missing.</i> Who was I? Why was I here? Why could I not leave?
</p>
<p>Where was 'here'?</p>
<br><p>I was missing myself.</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>Suddenly, there was a great burst of light through the Darkness. The light spread out and where it touched the Darkness the Darkness disappeared. The light spread until the patch of Dark Thing had vanished, and there was only a gentle shining, and through the shining came the stars, dear and pure.</i></p>
<br><hr><br><p>Darkness, and the gentle hum of crickets, singing the song of silence. Did they know..? They were my only company, yet they made feel more alone. Waves washing on sand. Waves pounding against my skull. No escape from the waves, only brief moments of relief, of rest, before the next one came.
</p>
<p>I don't know how long I stayed there. I only remember the nights, for in the nights I could see the stars. Slowly, I watched the moon wane, until it was only a scratch in the sky. That was me — a mere sliver. And then it was gone.
</p>
<p>I watched it come back, achieving its former glory, a bright disc whose reflection glimmered in the seawater, surrounded by millions of twinkling lights. I watched it fade once more. And the cycle continued.
</p>
<p>The days passed in a haze of aimless meandering, full of ceaseless rhythmic waves and the feeling of sand against my bare feet. I was confused; I thought of everything and nothing, and felt no emotions, only a sense of emptiness. It was a peaceful time, although I didn't realize it. A monotonous sort of peace, soon to be shattered.
</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>Then, slowly, the shining dwindled until it, too, was gone, and there was nothing but stars and starlight. No shadows. No fear. Only the stars and the clear
darkness of space, quite different from the fearful darkness
of the Thing.
</i></p>
<br><hr><br><p>Shattered by the pain.
</p>
<p>It came in waves, as everything did: first in my head, a hideous headache and my face contorting, threatening to break apart, to fall to pieces. Then it spread, slowly: my arms, my legs, my body, two sharp pinpoints in my lower back that became small fires, constantly burning and leaving me reduced to screams.
</p>
<p>The screams were for my sake, of course. Nobody was around, and even if they were, I don't think they could have helped me. They couldn't have stopped the pain. I didn't know how to make it cease; I couldn't even think; the waves washed away everything, and me with them.
</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>Tell us exactly what happened, then, please, Charles
Wallace said in a small voice.</i>
</p>
<p align="center"><i>It was a star, Mrs. Whatsit said sadly. A star giving
up its life in battle with the Thing. It won, oh, yes, my
children, it won.<br>But it lost its life in the winning.</i></p>
<br><hr><br><p>The pain disappeared — slowly, of course, and in waves of relief before it came back again, albeit with less burn, less sickening convulsions. I was eventually left stranded on the same beach as before, the same sand tickling my face.
</p>
<p>But it was different. I was different.
</p>
<p>I couldn't move for days, even after the pain stopped. As I laid there, remembering what it felt like to breathe without pain, I saw the stars once again. I stared at them, reveling in their wonder, as I used to. But this time, I began to remember.
</p>
<p>With the remembering came pain, perhaps even worse than before. And this time, the pain did not come in waves: it stayed, a sore ache in my heart splitting me apart, and it would never leave.

<h1>II. SHADOW</h1>
<p>The wings were beautiful, strong and built for speed, a sweeping twenty feet wide or so when stretched out fully. I used them cautiously at first; when a few experimental flaps took me on a breathtaking journey across the sea, I found them to my liking.
</p>
<p>Learning how to control my flight proved easier than one would imagine. My new muscles seemed to know precisely what to do: unfolding neatly from my sides a split second after I launched into the air; a slight angling to carry me with the breeze; tipping one wing down to carry me in a graceful arc. I found myself spending hours wheeling in circles high above the air, then racing out above the sea, diving and banking moments before hitting the water, skimming the surface and feeling the fresh spray of waves against my face.
</p>
<p>It was exhilarating. It was unlike anything I'd ever known before, and it was this flying, more than anything else, that made my transition bearable.</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>The Sun's daughter was fair, with pale skin and tresses of silver. She doted on her father day and night, and he loved her dearly. He would have done almost anything she asked. Yet one day, she approached him with a request that he dared not grant, for fear of losing her forever.</i>
</p>
<p align="center"> <b>Father,</b> <i>she said haltingly —</i> <b>Father, let me marry the Earth.</b>
</p>
<br><hr><br><p>I was not hideous; on the contrary, as I glanced down at my reflection in the starlit sea, I found myself somewhat stunned by my simple beauty. My scales were of a deep, indigo shade - almost black, but with the moon's light reflecting off the waters, the colours were just barely distinguishable from the darkness that enveloped the world around me. My stomach and the underside of my wings were of a lighter hue, nearer to the hazy cornflower blue of dusk. However, it was my eyes that struck me the most when I first caught sight of them glinting back at me; they were a brilliant shade of azure, a sole remnant of the grandeur that once flowed through every inch of my being.</p>
<p>I see, now, why this flying meant so much to me: it felt almost as if I could once more fade into the vast darkness; as if I was, once more, part of the night sky. Small. Insignificant. Beautiful.
</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>The great Sun was silent in his rage. Should this puny Earth, whom he blessed every day with his warmth, take away the daughter he so adored?</i>
</p>
<p align="center"><i><b>Please, Father... I love him so...</b> A sudden flash of light blinded the girl, and she averted her eyes, frightened.</i>
</p>
<br><hr><br><p>I was not a fool, and it did not take me long to realize that my circ<i></i>umstances were abnormal. I was supposed to be extinct, gone — I'd given up my life willingly, seeking death without remorse, only to have it evade me. There had to have been a reason for this my metamorphosis, not to mention my exile to this island.
</p><p>For days, perhaps even weeks or months, I assumed the heavens would reveal the reason to me at some point, seeing as they had sent me there in the first place. As time passed and nothing changed, however, I began to wonder if I was not supposed to seek out the answer for myself.</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><b>No.</b> <i>The animosity in her father's reply sparked tears; she turned and ran. Seeing the shine in his beloved daughter's eyes and knowing he had been the cause of such distress, the Sun sank into a deep state of melancholy. His rays ceased to be warm and bright, and thus the first winter was brought upon the Earth.</i>
</p>
<br><hr><br><p>Curiosity won out, eventually, and I resolved to take the initiative myself. As I was unsure how far I would have to travel, I decided that instead of embarking on one long journey, I would simply fly out and return each day, allowing myself further as the days passed, until I came across something other than incessant waves.</p>
<p>It did not take long. I realize in retrospect that I had indeed been meant to take the journey myself, for it was something I could not have undertaken until I was strong enough. However, after the time spent recovering and getting used to my new form within the sanctuary of my island — for I had begun to think of it as mine, now — I was powerful enough to travel leagues within a short amount of time.</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>The girl's sorrow was vast. Tears fell from her face in multitudes, bursting into tiny flames and scattering over the wide expanse of space. Unable to face her father ever again and forbidden to go near to her love, she followed the Earth from a distance. And when the Sun turned his face away at the end of the day, she dared to shed her own sweet light, illuminating her teardrops in the sky — an everlasting reminder of what she could never have.</i>
</p>
<br><hr><br><p>My destination was easy to spot, of course. A small dock, forgotten, announced the existence of a quaint seaside amalgam of faded wooden houses and colourful fishermen's marketplaces. It was situated upon a peninsula, though what rested on the land beyond the water would forever remain a mystery to me. Nondescript as this little village was, it stood out plainly against the azure of miles and miles of water surrounding it.</p>
<p>Yet what caught my attention at first was not this village, but what surrounded it: a darkness, for lack of a better term. It was almost invisible in the daytime; I could pick out a faint grey shimmer in the air, almost like a mirage. Yet it was very much tangible; the moment I flew into it, my wings sagged and I fought to sustain myself.</p>
<p>It was a morass of negative energy, unlike anything I'd ever experienced before. It sapped my strength, enervating me so much that within seconds, I knew I had to land. I stumbled clumsily onto the dock, panting, discomfited and concerned by this new development. For all my timeless wisdom, I was, for once, completely unsure as to what I was dealing with.</p>
<p>It was perhaps four or five in the afternoon. I did not return to my island.</p>

<h1>III. REMEMBRANCE</h1>
<p>When the bearded fisherman first noticed me lying there on the dock, he failed to realize what I was. <i>Yeh shudn'av come here,</i> he began to say, <i>it ain't safe no more in these parts —</i> and then his small brown eyes bulged and he felt silent.</p>
<p><i>Hello,</i> I rasped in response. My own voice surprised me. I was not accustomed to communicating verbally as humans did, and had not spoken in this new form until now, but I saw understanding flicker across his face. I dipped my head and swallowed hard, and when I spoke again, my voice was clearer and flowed with a rich timbre. <i>What is your name?</i></p>
<p><i>Ah — Mike, your ma--er, Oh Great One.</i></p>
<p>I blinked back my amuse-ment. <i>You need not fear me, I am here to assist. What is this thing that plagues you?</i> I flicked my tail at the distorted sky, observing the way he jumped slightly at my movement. He still feared me, but I suppose I could not fault him, for I was almost thrice his size. It was something I was soon to get used to.</p>
<p><i>We don' know, Your Greatness, but it jus' shown up some weeks ago, an' we been sufferin' since.</i> He shook his head. I noted the creases that fatigue and consternation had created on his brow, and felt sympathy stir within me. I was still weak from the brief encounter I'd had with the strange mist; one could only imagine what living weeks under its influence could do to a village of humble people.</p>
<p>Before I could reply, we were joined by a stout woman whom I perceived to be the fisherman's wife. She was dressed in simple working clothes, and her greyed brown hair was tied up in a messy bun. Her faded blue eyes were kind, and I could tell that once she was beautiful, but time had not been kind to her. (It's funny, really, and rather sad, how humans age.)</p>
<p><i>Michael,</i> she gasped, hurrying to his side. She grasped his arm tightly, staring at me. Then, her jaw agape, she knelt clumsily before me. <i>We have been waiting... so long... our Savior,</i> she stammered. <i>Finally, finally you are here, finally we are saved.</i> Her eyes shone with a brightness that reflected my home, and I felt a kind of panic. How was I to tell this woman, on the verge of weeping with gratitude, that I had no idea what she was talking about, that I had no clue what role I was to play here?</p>
<p>I merely dipped my head in response. <i>Tell me your name... and please, tell me more about what precisely I'm facing here.</i></p>
<p>The woman nodded fervently. <i>I am Helen. You must come back with us for supper. Then, after dusk, we will return, and you will see.</i> The grave portent in her words did nothing to alleviate my apprehensions, but I gestured for her to lead the way, and allowed these two strangers to invite me into their home.</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>I didn't mean to tell you, Mrs. Whatsit faltered. I didn't mean ever to let you know. But, oh, my dears, I did so love being a star!</i></p>
<br><hr><br><p>The home of Helen and Michael (Mike, he insisted to be called) was humble to say the least — furnished with only the bare necessities, the most extravagant item of decor the abode contained was a tattered mahogany rug lining the floor, the richness of the colour long faded from use. There was a sofa, as well, one that must have been there for years; it faced a tall bookshelf which leaned against the wall, as if making up for the lack of windows. I surveyed the scene of indigence before me with a pang of pity, noting the musty wooden walls — the paint having peeled to a degree where there were only specks left — and the lone table in the corner surrounded by barren chairs that seemed as if they would break the moment one sat upon them.</p>
<p>Despite its state of lacking, however, there was something — the way Helen darted about, humming and preparing dinner; the way the immaculate floor had evidently been swept with much care; the way Michael tossed his jacket upon the sofa and stretched out with a sigh of contentment — that still gave this place a welcoming aura. I tread carefully, unsure as yet how the small room could possibly accommodate my size, not wanting to disturb this homely setting with my clumsiness.</p>
<p>They referred to me as <i>Savior</i> and <i>Great One</i>, and when they requested me to make myself at home, I begged them to grant me another name, one that did not weigh on my back with dread. They were silent for a second as they thought, and at this moment, a child burst into the room, his youthful energy only heightened by whatever emotion crossed his face when he spotted me. (Alarm? Confusion? Joy and excitement, as Helen had shown earlier? I was not sure; perhaps it was an amalgam of all of those.)</p>
<p><i>Is it true, Mama?</i> he whispered as his eyes shone; my sense of hearing having been heightened, I had to pretend not to hear and instead occupy myself by staring at the rusted titles on the bookshelf beside me. <i>Anna Karenina. The Old Man and The Sea. The Great Gatsby. Robinson Crusoe.</i> and so on — a respectable collection, to be sure; Michael and Helen must have been avid readers in their lifetime. I angled my ears slightly to catch the child's next words. <i>Our Savior has come!</i></p>
<p><i>Yes, it's true.</i></p>
<p><i>Per'aps,</i> Mike said — he spoke with a carrying voice, and I perked up in his direction — <i>per'aps you can christen 'im, son. Our Saver's requested a name, but me an' your mama, we ain't got much imagination.</i> He winked at the child, then smiled at me conspiratorially; I had little choice but to return his smile, as the solicitous nature of these charming people had already taken root in my heart.</p><p>
</p><p><i>No way!</i> The child's eyes lit up as they would at Christmastime, and he scampered to my side, only to balk at the last second and stare at me wide-eyed from a distance. <i>You're so beautiful...</i> he whispered in awe, his gaze raking over my scales. A ripple of pride washed down my back, and I blinked at him, knowing what he really desired.</p>
<p><i>You're free to touch me, if you'd like,</i> I murmured to him, soft enough to escape the ears of the watching parents. He nodded, pursing his lips tightly, and slowly reached forward to stroke my scales, ever-so-gently, a gossamer touch. Helen made a noise of alarm, but was quickly hushed by Michael, who must have seen in my eyes the inexplicable affection I felt toward this child. <i>What is your name?</i></p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>In our world, said Eustace, a star is a huge ball of flaming gas.</i>
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Even in your world, my son, that is not what a star is, but only what it is made of. </i></p>
<br><hr><br><p><i>I'm Kayden,</i> chirped the boy, <i>and I'm nine and my favourite colour is purple. What's your — oh, wait, I'm supposed to make one for you.</i></p>
<p>I was silent as he pondered, his little eyebrows furrowed in concentration. Then: <i>What do you think about Ryeus?</i></p>
<p><i>Ryeus.</i> The name rolled easily off my tongue, and I felt an unexpected spark of pride at the prospect of being the bearer of such a regal, yet simple, name. <i>I believe that will do just fine.</i></p>
<p>Kayden beamed, showing off the gap between his two upper front teeth. <i>It means Star here in Stormdale. Or Morning. Morning Star. Whichever.</i></p>
<p>I nodded. <i>It is fitting,</i> I murmured quietly, and with the words came a faint pull of nostalgia, a hint of the pain I had pushed aside long ago. I was distracted by the child; he was running his fingers lightly over my scales again, seemingly captivated by the lambent reflection of the dim bulb that illuminated the room. An idea struck me, and I slowly craned my neck to reach my right flank, where Kayden was and where I knew the scales were plentiful. Delicately, I grasped one with my sharpened teeth, and pulled it out with a swift jerk of my head.</p>
<p>Kayden gasped, but I quickly allayed his consternation by dropping the scale neatly before his feet. <i>I would very much like for you to keep this,</i> I said. <i>And I will tell you a secret: this scale, as well as my entire being, is created from starstuffs — the strongest material in existence. I grant this piece to you, now, so that you as well may be strong: have faith in the face of asperity, and remember me when you have lost your way. Remember that the stars will always be there to guide you.</i></p>
<p>He grabbed the scale, held onto it so tightly that the whites of his knuckles showed, and stared at me in grave silence. We understood each other better, perhaps, than did the adults and I: for example, I knew that for some gifts, gratitude could never be expressed well enough; and he knew that for this next undertaking, I would need the strength of the stars more than he did.</p>
<p><i>How will you save us?</i></p>
<p><i>I do not know.</i></p>

<h1>IV. VICTORY</h1>
<p>Helen prepared a great dinner that night; a feast, really, by their humble standards. The meal began with a roll of bread and butter, a condiment that was scarce around these parts. There were side dishes of sweet potatoes and corn, salted to perfection. The main course was fish, of course — two large salmon, one fried and the other roasted and sprinkled with lemon sauce, salt, and a few rare, precious pinches of spices. I felt almost humiliated by my beneficiaries, barely getting by themselves, who had spared no resource in order to make my visit here the most pleasant possible.</p>
<p>I ate my fill, and though they encouraged me to take more, I refused, requesting that they save the rest for themselves. Helen reluctantly agreed, and asked Kayden to put aside the dishes. I rested my head between my forelegs, blinking slowly and taking in the scene before me: a warm home, basked in love and, though lacking materially, wanting for nothing. It was not something I had been able to partake in before, and my heart was filled with gratitude for the gift this family had not known they were giving me.</p>
<p><i>It's time,</i> Helen said eventually. Her lips were pressed into a tight, thin line. <i>I'll bring you to the dock.</i> She glanced sideways at Michael and Kayden, and her message was clear: they would not be coming with us.</p>
<p>I got to my feet, my contentment tinged with foreboding at what was to come. I dipped my head to the two sitting solemnly at the table. <i>Thank you for allowing me into your abode, and for sharing your food and drink with me. You were very good hosts, and I am grateful.</i> I looked at Kayden, then, and nodded at the scale he was still clinging so tightly to. <i>Remember what I told you, Kayden, and do not fear.</i> He nodded vigorously in response, though said nothing, his youthful brown eyes wide.</p>
<p>Helen pushed open the door, and I followed behind her. As the frigid evening air replaced the warmth of the cozy cottage, I began to feel a weight sinking in my chest. We spoke little on the short walk there, and I appreciated Helen's silence; perhaps there was little she could have said, but there was little I wanted to know.</p>
<p>We halted just before the dock where I had landed earlier that day. My guide looked up to the sky, a grim expr ssion on her face, and I followed her gaze. Dark grey clouds swirled slowly; not the usual crepuscular wispy tendrils, but a thick, austere blanket that seemed to serve as a portent of death. An ominous, trenchant aura hung about the area — similar to that which I had encountered this afternoon, only tenfold greater. My sandpaper throat throbbed as I swallowed hard.</p>
<p><i>This is where I leave you.</i> Helen's voice took me by surprise; distracted by the scene above us and by what I was about to face, I had momentarily forgotten her presence. I tore my gaze from the sky to meet her light brown eyes, studying her carefully. She may have very well been the last human I was to ever meet. Her hair had been taken down from its bun before, and now fell freely, framing her face with mousy grey wisps. She wore an dark cotton cardigan, which she clutched tightly against her bosom in order to better protect from the wintry sea breeze. Age and poverty had brought tired creases to her eyes, and they deepened as she smiled kindly at me, though concern was apparent throughout her demeanor. </p>
<p><i>Have faith, Ryeus. You were brought to us for a reason.</i></p>
<p><i>Thank you, Helen. I will not forget your generosity.</i> My words were genuine, and she must have sensed so, for her smile widened.</p>
<p><i>Farewell, Savior.</i> She wavered for a brief moment, then left, walking at a brisk pace. Wishing to defer our parting and my subsequent task, I watched until her silhouette had faded into the approaching dusk.</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
<br>Never let it fade away</i></p>
<br><hr><br><p>Dusk that night was as I had never seen before — another omen. I watched as a deep shade of indigo crept in to cover the sky from my right, like splashes of dark watercolour upon a pale canvas. There was no lavender, there was no pink; there was only a swarthy purple-black, slowly but surely unfurling to cover the horizon.</p>
<p>The indigo was now blossoming from my left as well, washing in to coalesce with the other stream of purple-blue. It might have been a beautiful sight, if all of my senses had not been screaming of an inimical presence in my midst. The grey began to swirl, spiraling in arbitrary directions, growing all the while. I shifted my position, hoping to obtain a better look. As I did so, I happened to glance downwards and realized, with a start, that the indigo stretching across the sky matched the shade of my scales. Though this struck me as odd, I failed to realize the import of this at the moment.</p>
<p>I continued to watch as the darkness bloomed above me, and when there remained only a sliver of the former pale sky, I strode to the edge of the dock and prayed for intrepidity.</p>
<p><i>My name,</i> I called, addressing the grey mass above me, <i>is Ryeus Lumen.</i> Morning Star, just as Kayden had said. It occurred to me that the night had just begun. I shook my head and continued, my words audacious but my voice almost tremulous. <i>I have been sent to rid this village of the evil you have induced.</i> I knew I need not talk very loud, for whatever being this was, there was no question that it would've been powerful enough to hear me from some distance. The question, now, was whether or not it was willing to answer my call.</p>
<p><i>Come down, whatever you are, and show yourself.</i></p>
<p>I was distantly aware of my heart pulsing, the clamourous pounding in my ears reminding me that in this form, I was very much mortal. I did not know what I was up against, nor did I know my own strengths of weaknesses; I only knew that my trepidation meant nothing, for this was what I had been sent to do — this was, to call upon a platitude, my destiny. (The irony of the situation was that once, I was a part of fate, a part of those which decided the destinies of others. It made me wonder who had decided mine.)</p>
<p>I waited for what seemed eons, though for my former self time was a meaningless concept. I waited, ignoring the incessant throbbing in my ears and the dryness of my throat, until slowly, a small dark orb — the same indigo as that of the sky and of my scales — detached itself from the grey haze and began to float downwards.</p>
<p>I felt several things at once: revulsion, curiosity, loathing, and — most terrifying of all — I felt a pang of recognition.</p>
<p>I <i>knew</i> this orb.</p>
<p>It was my kin.</p>
<p><i>You are a star as well.</i> I had not meant to speak; the words were but a breath, but I knew by the metallic laughter floating through my mind that the darkness had heard.</p>
<p><i>I was.</i> Though my ears heard nothing, the words rang clear in my mind with an almost vociferous intensity. <i>I was, yes, but no longer; now, I am more.</i></p>
<p><i>How can you be more?</i> I cried; with its words, all intention of keeping my thoughts tacit had vanished. <i>We were the kings of the universe. How could you possibly be more?</i> Again, the trenchant pain of remembering, of clinging onto the last vestiges of my former blaze of glory. I gasped to alleviate the pain, but the air was tainted with inexplicable malice, causing my chest to throb more violently.</p>
<p><i>I was once like you,</i> the darkness told me, and I detected a certain undertone — pity? I shuddered in abhorrence. <i>But Ryeus, you must realize. The others are frightened; they are afraid of their full potential. They are too careful for their own good.</i></p>
<p>I opened my mouth to retort a reply, but the darkness continued, more insistent:</p>
<p><i>The humans have forgotten us, Ryeus. They have forgotten the constellations, the reading of the skies; astronomers are long dead and forgotten. They do not deserve to live. We are far more powerful than they. For heaven's sake, we can harness the power of the stars!</i></p>
<p><i>This is not our responsibility,</i> I hissed — the darkness was wrong, it had to be wrong, it must be wrong. I remembered Michael and his geniality; Helen and her altruism; Kayden and his youthful reverence; they gave me strength. <i>There is a reason stars are made with an expiration date.</i></p>
<p>Again, the metallic laugh I so despised. <i>You cannot fight me, Ryeus. I have made it past the date; there must have been a reason, something I was meant to do, some purpose for me to continue living...</i></p>
<p><i>That may be true,</i> I replied quietly, <i>but this... this is not the reason.</i></p>
<p><i>How do you know?</i> The words were laced with gentle pity, and the patronizing tone awoke within me a blaze of anger: anger at its blasphemous words, anger for the sake of the humans who had touched my soul in just a few short hours and whom it was calling worthless, and although perhaps unfair to this particular fallen star, anger at my previous life lost.</p>
<p>I curled my lips back in contempt, baring my teeth. <i>Because I, too, have made it past the date. And I have been sent to stop you.</i></p>
<p>It is difficult to pinpoint what happened afterwards — it seemed that I launched myself into the air and, instantaneously, the dark orb transformed into a form much like that of myself. The same wingspan, the same colour scheme, the same pointed claws... In fact, we might have been twins, save that its eyes were a solid black.</p>
<p>We circled each other in the air warily; judging from our respective forms, it would be an even battle, with no clear winner. Perhaps it had the upper hand, for we were under its skies and grey clouds — however, I had no intention of fighting here.</p>
<p><i>I had hoped it wouldn't come to this.</i> The words were a sigh, echoing in my mind. <i>I do not wish to fight you, brother.</i></p>
<p>I growled, clenching my claws. <i>I am not your brother,</i> I hissed through gritted teeth, <i>and I never will be.</i></p>
<p><i>If you wish.</i></p>
<p>It launched itself at me, and I turned tail and fled, thanking the skies that I had trained myself to go full speed in flight. Evidently, my enemy had not expected me to run, for it wavered for a couple seconds before following suit. Thus began a chase across the sea. Grimly, I tucked my legs tightly under my belly and poured on the speed, silently praying for my wings to hold. I hoped to lead it to the island where I had spent my first weeks as a mortal, a place where we could battle without chance of harming a human. My mission would have been null had I compromised the safety of the village I was trying to save.</p>
<p>I didn't make it to the island. I felt it behind me, and only had time to duck under and narrowly avoid its lashing claws. I retaliated by snapping at its tail, and we began to fight mid-sea, with claws and white fire and streams of invective. I used my anger, my desperation, my pain — but try as I might, we were still evenly matched, and I was already out of breath from the chase.</p>
<p><i>Heavens, help me!</i> I begged as I ducked another slash, aimed for my exposed stomach; its tail whipped my face, then, and I felt a cut forming under my eye. <i>You sent me here, you must see me through this!</i> I was weakening. <i>Please... I cannot fail now...</i> My wingbeats were slower, less powerful; my enemy must have sensed this, for it began a fresh barrage of attacks, the worst of which I would soon no longer have the energy to fend off.</p>
<p><i>I warned you, Ryeus,</i> — another sigh in my head, another slice and dodge — <i>you cannot defeat me...</i></p>
<p>The heavens were silent, but I forced myself to battle despair. There had to be another way. Some means of stopping this evil from effacing the human world...</p>
<p>The realization came, a shooting star in the dark of night, and I marveled at how long it had taken me. I was not meant to live. Once more I was give up my life, once more I was to sacrifice myself for the hope of something better to take my place — and that of the malevolence I was to take with me...</p>
<p>I stopped fighting.</p>
<p>The evil jibed at me, viciously raking my scales to expose a stripe of my left flank — <i>have you relented already?</i> — but when I stared resolutely at its coal eyes and refused to move, it ceased battling as well.</p>
<p>Evil had honour, after all.</p>
<p><i>Ryeus.</i> Its voice was cautious, but warm. <i>My brother. I knew you would comprehend my objective eventually.</i></p>
<p>I studied its face, just as I had studied that of dear Helen's not so long ago, and marveled at the dissimilarities. Whereas I had looked upon her features with endearment, with this incubus there was only a void of emotion tainted with antipathy. I would feel no regret liberating the beauty of this world from the wretched menace in front of me; I only wished I had had more opportunity to indulge in quotidian pleasures during my sojourn here.</p>
<p><i>This is no capitulation,</i> I said. <i>And you are not my brother.</i></p>
<p>It is difficult to explain exactly what took place thereafter, for the reason that I am not certain myself; I was guided by intuition, and inexplicably understood that there were some attributes of a star I still possessed. For example, the ability to instantaneously self-destruct — to move up one's expiration date.</p>
<p>I saw understanding flicker in its eyes, and the voice spoke with poorly hidden trepidation. <i>What you plan to perform will be a futile effort; you are no longer a star.</i></p>
<p><i>No,</i> I replied; <i>I am mortal, as you are.</i></p>
<p>A slow pressure began to build inside my chest, gaining heat, growing into a flame, then slowly swelling into a stream of white fire, begging to be freed, to consume its targets...</p>
<p>The blistering blaze burst out of my mouth, enfolding the fallen star. The sound it made was a howl so trenchant that it seared itself into my soul and my memories forever. This was the last thing I perceived from this world before it was devoured by an ivory inferno.</p>
<p>Finally at ease, I closed my eyes and welcomed my subsequent oblivion; if I strained, I could see in the faint distance a multitude of scintillating stars...</p>

<h1>V. REBIRTH</h1>
<p>Even as I dreamt, their brilliance shattered my vision into a million twinkling lights.</p>
<p>The stars; they were the last thing I saw, and the first thing I saw, and everything in between. There was no escape. But I wanted none, for in the stars I saw hope, and glory, and everything I'd wanted, everything I ever would want.</p>
<p>They felt so cold, and far away.</p>
<p>I clung to them as to the beacon of a lighthouse. I was lost at sea, unable to escape the waves of terror and confusion; the sense of loss I felt, the sense of <i>missing.</i> Who was I? Why was I here? Why could I not leave?</p>
<p>Where was 'here'?</p>
<p>I was lost...</p>
<br><br><p>And then I shone. I shone with the brilliance of my memories, and it was everything — <i>everything</i> — I had recalled it would be...</p>
<p>Here was home.</p>
<br><br><p>I had one last task: the boy, Kayden. I approached him in his slumber, easing my way into his dreams. They were fitful, I found, for one so young — but they were of an evil that had now passed, to my gratification.</p>
<p><i>Ryeus,</i> he said, recognizing me immediately; I bowed my head to him.</p>
<p><i>Are we safe? Is it gone?</i></p>
<p>I smiled, and he beamed a smile that almost put me to shame.</p>
<p><i>You must keep the village — Stormdale — safe now, Kayden,</i> I told him gently. <i>I am entrusting its care to you.</i> He gaped at me, wide-eyed, but I knew this charge would be held responsibly by this youthful, earnest soul. <i>Do not fear. You know what to do already.</i> I nodded to the starstuff shaped as a dragon scale, hung on a piece of dark thread around his neck.</p>
<p><i>But where are you going now, Ryeus? Will you not come back?</i></p>
<p><i>I am returning to where I belong... but I will be with you always.</i></p>
<p>The dream began to fade. The last thing I saw was his small hand reaching up to grasp the scale tightly...</p>

<h1>EPILOGUE</h1>
<p>The cottage was furnished with only the bare necessities; the most extravagant item of decor the abode contained was a tattered mahogany rug lining the floor, the richness of the colour long faded from use. There was a sofa, as well, one that must have been there for years; it faced a small television that flickered lazily now, showing some reality show or other, the bright smiles of kids and their respective parents alternating in rapid flashes on the screen.</p>
<p>Two small girls played nearby. One of them, a brunette with mischievous dark eyes, grabbed a doll from her fair-haired sister and held it high above her head. The other girl began to scream, her bright blue eyes brimming with angry tears. <i>Heleeeeenaaaaa! Give it back give it back give it back!</i></p>
<p><i>Shush that ruckus, Mia.</i> The blonde girl ceased screaming at the sound of her mother's voice and resorted to glaring maliciously at her sister, her small hands trying in vain to reach the doll. <i>And Helena, give that doll back to your sister.</i> She reluctantly complied, sticking her tongue out at Mia who turned her back as soon as she had regained possession of the doll.</p>
<p>The mother, a woman of roughly thirty who went by the name of Anna, had a face that portrayed a sagacity beyond her years. Her hair fell in pretty brown ringlets down her back, and giving her a youthful prettiness despite the plain lavender dress she wore. She was tall, and presented a rather imposing figure as she frowned sternly down at her daughters even while cradling a third child — a boy — in her arms. <i><b>Behave,</b> you two.</i></p>
<p>There was a gentle tapping at the door. Shooting a look at the two girls — a silent warning to not cause any more trouble — Anna hurried to the entrance, still holding the baby. Helena began to side-eye the doll in her mother's absence, but was soon distracted by Anna's cry of delight. The two girls exchanged a curious look, wondering if they should go inspect the new arrival.</p>
<p>It turns out that there was no need, for Anna soon walked back into the room, the newcomer in tow. It was an elderly man, one whom the girls evidently recognized, as they both jumped to their feet to embrace him with cries of <i>Grandpa! Grandpa!</i> His movements were lethargic, but the corners of his eyes crinkled in a yet lively happiness at the sight of his grandchildren.</p>
<p>The baby began crying, then, and Anna crooned softly to him, petting his hair gently in an effort to appease him. <i>Shh, Kayden, it's alright, shhh, it's only Grandpa... You would think that one would be more merry upon meeting their namesake,</i> she chuckled, directing this last comment at her father. He only smiled — the baby's cries were music to his ears — and gradually made his way over to the sofa, where he lowered himself with a small sigh.</p>
<p><i>I'm getting too old for this world, Anna.</i> His tone was light, but she frowned.</p>
<p><i>Don't say that, Papa.</i></p>
<p><i>It's true. But do not fear for me; there are greater things than this life, and I look forward to the journey ahead.</i></p>
<p>She said nothing in response, but walked over to join her father. Little Kayden was still whimpering, but when his grandfather took him into his arms, he fell silent, enraptured by the shiny object that dangled from the elder's throat.</p>
<p><i>Ah, yes. This I must pass on.</i></p>
<p><i>What is it, Papa?</i> Anna's curiosity piqued; she'd noticed that her father rarely took off the pendant, though she never thought to question why exactly that was.</p>
<p><i>This is a gift,</i> her father replied, <i>that I now pass on to little Kayden. But for now, Anna, you must take care of it, until he is old enough — it will not be long.</i></p>
<p>She swallowed, unsure of what exactly he was asking of her. <i>How will I be sure? That he is ready, I mean.</i></p>
<p><i>Oh, he will understand its significance in time; little boys usually do. Just remind him. Remind him to look at the stars, to remember their majesty and power... and remind him, above all, that the human soul is made of the essence of starstuff — strength, and righteousness, and the willingness to fight for what is good.</i></p>

<h1>I. AWAKENING</h1>
<p>Even as I dreamt, their brilliance shattered my vision into a million twinkling lights.
</p>
<p>The stars; they were the last thing I saw, and the first thing I saw, and everything in between. There was no escape. But I wanted none, for in the stars I saw hope, and glory, and everything I'd wanted, everything I ever would want.
</p>
<p>They felt so cold, and far away.
</p>
<p>I clung to them as to the beacon of a lighthouse. I was lost at sea, unable to escape the waves of terror and confusion; the sense of loss I felt, the sense of <i>missing.</i> Who was I? Why was I here? Why could I not leave?
</p>
<p>Where was 'here'?</p>
<br><p>I was missing myself.</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>Suddenly, there was a great burst of light through the Darkness. The light spread out and where it touched the Darkness the Darkness disappeared. The light spread until the patch of Dark Thing had vanished, and there was only a gentle shining, and through the shining came the stars, dear and pure.</i></p>
<br><hr><br><p>Darkness, and the gentle hum of crickets, singing the song of silence. Did they know..? They were my only company, yet they made feel more alone. Waves washing on sand. Waves pounding against my skull. No escape from the waves, only brief moments of relief, of rest, before the next one came.
</p>
<p>I don't know how long I stayed there. I only remember the nights, for in the nights I could see the stars. Slowly, I watched the moon wane, until it was only a scratch in the sky. That was me — a mere sliver. And then it was gone.
</p>
<p>I watched it come back, achieving its former glory, a bright disc whose reflection glimmered in the seawater, surrounded by millions of twinkling lights. I watched it fade once more. And the cycle continued.
</p>
<p>The days passed in a haze of aimless meandering, full of ceaseless rhythmic waves and the feeling of sand against my bare feet. I was confused; I thought of everything and nothing, and felt no emotions, only a sense of emptiness. It was a peaceful time, although I didn't realize it. A monotonous sort of peace, soon to be shattered.
</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>Then, slowly, the shining dwindled until it, too, was gone, and there was nothing but stars and starlight. No shadows. No fear. Only the stars and the clear
darkness of space, quite different from the fearful darkness
of the Thing.
</i></p>
<br><hr><br><p>Shattered by the pain.
</p>
<p>It came in waves, as everything did: first in my head, a hideous headache and my face contorting, threatening to break apart, to fall to pieces. Then it spread, slowly: my arms, my legs, my body, two sharp pinpoints in my lower back that became small fires, constantly burning and leaving me reduced to screams.
</p>
<p>The screams were for my sake, of course. Nobody was around, and even if they were, I don't think they could have helped me. They couldn't have stopped the pain. I didn't know how to make it cease; I couldn't even think; the waves washed away everything, and me with them.
</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>Tell us exactly what happened, then, please, Charles
Wallace said in a small voice.</i>
</p>
<p align="center"><i>It was a star, Mrs. Whatsit said sadly. A star giving
up its life in battle with the Thing. It won, oh, yes, my
children, it won.<br>But it lost its life in the winning.</i></p>
<br><hr><br><p>The pain disappeared — slowly, of course, and in waves of relief before it came back again, albeit with less burn, less sickening convulsions. I was eventually left stranded on the same beach as before, the same sand tickling my face.
</p>
<p>But it was different. I was different.
</p>
<p>I couldn't move for days, even after the pain stopped. As I laid there, remembering what it felt like to breathe without pain, I saw the stars once again. I stared at them, reveling in their wonder, as I used to. But this time, I began to remember.
</p>
<p>With the remembering came pain, perhaps even worse than before. And this time, the pain did not come in waves: it stayed, a sore ache in my heart splitting me apart, and it would never leave.

<h1>II. SHADOW</h1>
<p>The wings were beautiful, strong and built for speed, a sweeping twenty feet wide or so when stretched out fully. I used them cautiously at first; when a few experimental flaps took me on a breathtaking journey across the sea, I found them to my liking.
</p>
<p>Learning how to control my flight proved easier than one would imagine. My new muscles seemed to know precisely what to do: unfolding neatly from my sides a split second after I launched into the air; a slight angling to carry me with the breeze; tipping one wing down to carry me in a graceful arc. I found myself spending hours wheeling in circles high above the air, then racing out above the sea, diving and banking moments before hitting the water, skimming the surface and feeling the fresh spray of waves against my face.
</p>
<p>It was exhilarating. It was unlike anything I'd ever known before, and it was this flying, more than anything else, that made my transition bearable.</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>The Sun's daughter was fair, with pale skin and tresses of silver. She doted on her father day and night, and he loved her dearly. He would have done almost anything she asked. Yet one day, she approached him with a request that he dared not grant, for fear of losing her forever.</i>
</p>
<p align="center"> <b>Father,</b> <i>she said haltingly —</i> <b>Father, let me marry the Earth.</b>
</p>
<br><hr><br><p>I was not hideous; on the contrary, as I glanced down at my reflection in the starlit sea, I found myself somewhat stunned by my simple beauty. My scales were of a deep, indigo shade - almost black, but with the moon's light reflecting off the waters, the colours were just barely distinguishable from the darkness that enveloped the world around me. My stomach and the underside of my wings were of a lighter hue, nearer to the hazy cornflower blue of dusk. However, it was my eyes that struck me the most when I first caught sight of them glinting back at me; they were a brilliant shade of azure, a sole remnant of the grandeur that once flowed through every inch of my being.</p>
<p>I see, now, why this flying meant so much to me: it felt almost as if I could once more fade into the vast darkness; as if I was, once more, part of the night sky. Small. Insignificant. Beautiful.
</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>The great Sun was silent in his rage. Should this puny Earth, whom he blessed every day with his warmth, take away the daughter he so adored?</i>
</p>
<p align="center"><i><b>Please, Father... I love him so...</b> A sudden flash of light blinded the girl, and she averted her eyes, frightened.</i>
</p>
<br><hr><br><p>I was not a fool, and it did not take me long to realize that my circ<i></i>umstances were abnormal. I was supposed to be extinct, gone — I'd given up my life willingly, seeking death without remorse, only to have it evade me. There had to have been a reason for this my metamorphosis, not to mention my exile to this island.
</p><p>For days, perhaps even weeks or months, I assumed the heavens would reveal the reason to me at some point, seeing as they had sent me there in the first place. As time passed and nothing changed, however, I began to wonder if I was not supposed to seek out the answer for myself.</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><b>No.</b> <i>The animosity in her father's reply sparked tears; she turned and ran. Seeing the shine in his beloved daughter's eyes and knowing he had been the cause of such distress, the Sun sank into a deep state of melancholy. His rays ceased to be warm and bright, and thus the first winter was brought upon the Earth.</i>
</p>
<br><hr><br><p>Curiosity won out, eventually, and I resolved to take the initiative myself. As I was unsure how far I would have to travel, I decided that instead of embarking on one long journey, I would simply fly out and return each day, allowing myself further as the days passed, until I came across something other than incessant waves.</p>
<p>It did not take long. I realize in retrospect that I had indeed been meant to take the journey myself, for it was something I could not have undertaken until I was strong enough. However, after the time spent recovering and getting used to my new form within the sanctuary of my island — for I had begun to think of it as mine, now — I was powerful enough to travel leagues within a short amount of time.</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>The girl's sorrow was vast. Tears fell from her face in multitudes, bursting into tiny flames and scattering over the wide expanse of space. Unable to face her father ever again and forbidden to go near to her love, she followed the Earth from a distance. And when the Sun turned his face away at the end of the day, she dared to shed her own sweet light, illuminating her teardrops in the sky — an everlasting reminder of what she could never have.</i>
</p>
<br><hr><br><p>My destination was easy to spot, of course. A small dock, forgotten, announced the existence of a quaint seaside amalgam of faded wooden houses and colourful fishermen's marketplaces. It was situated upon a peninsula, though what rested on the land beyond the water would forever remain a mystery to me. Nondescript as this little village was, it stood out plainly against the azure of miles and miles of water surrounding it.</p>
<p>Yet what caught my attention at first was not this village, but what surrounded it: a darkness, for lack of a better term. It was almost invisible in the daytime; I could pick out a faint grey shimmer in the air, almost like a mirage. Yet it was very much tangible; the moment I flew into it, my wings sagged and I fought to sustain myself.</p>
<p>It was a morass of negative energy, unlike anything I'd ever experienced before. It sapped my strength, enervating me so much that within seconds, I knew I had to land. I stumbled clumsily onto the dock, panting, discomfited and concerned by this new development. For all my timeless wisdom, I was, for once, completely unsure as to what I was dealing with.</p>
<p>It was perhaps four or five in the afternoon. I did not return to my island.</p>

<h1>III. REMEMBRANCE</h1>
<p>When the bearded fisherman first noticed me lying there on the dock, he failed to realize what I was. <i>Yeh shudn'av come here,</i> he began to say, <i>it ain't safe no more in these parts —</i> and then his small brown eyes bulged and he felt silent.</p>
<p><i>Hello,</i> I rasped in response. My own voice surprised me. I was not accustomed to communicating verbally as humans did, and had not spoken in this new form until now, but I saw understanding flicker across his face. I dipped my head and swallowed hard, and when I spoke again, my voice was clearer and flowed with a rich timbre. <i>What is your name?</i></p>
<p><i>Ah — Mike, your ma--er, Oh Great One.</i></p>
<p>I blinked back my amuse-ment. <i>You need not fear me, I am here to assist. What is this thing that plagues you?</i> I flicked my tail at the distorted sky, observing the way he jumped slightly at my movement. He still feared me, but I suppose I could not fault him, for I was almost thrice his size. It was something I was soon to get used to.</p>
<p><i>We don' know, Your Greatness, but it jus' shown up some weeks ago, an' we been sufferin' since.</i> He shook his head. I noted the creases that fatigue and consternation had created on his brow, and felt sympathy stir within me. I was still weak from the brief encounter I'd had with the strange mist; one could only imagine what living weeks under its influence could do to a village of humble people.</p>
<p>Before I could reply, we were joined by a stout woman whom I perceived to be the fisherman's wife. She was dressed in simple working clothes, and her greyed brown hair was tied up in a messy bun. Her faded blue eyes were kind, and I could tell that once she was beautiful, but time had not been kind to her. (It's funny, really, and rather sad, how humans age.)</p>
<p><i>Michael,</i> she gasped, hurrying to his side. She grasped his arm tightly, staring at me. Then, her jaw agape, she knelt clumsily before me. <i>We have been waiting... so long... our Savior,</i> she stammered. <i>Finally, finally you are here, finally we are saved.</i> Her eyes shone with a brightness that reflected my home, and I felt a kind of panic. How was I to tell this woman, on the verge of weeping with gratitude, that I had no idea what she was talking about, that I had no clue what role I was to play here?</p>
<p>I merely dipped my head in response. <i>Tell me your name... and please, tell me more about what precisely I'm facing here.</i></p>
<p>The woman nodded fervently. <i>I am Helen. You must come back with us for supper. Then, after dusk, we will return, and you will see.</i> The grave portent in her words did nothing to alleviate my apprehensions, but I gestured for her to lead the way, and allowed these two strangers to invite me into their home.</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>I didn't mean to tell you, Mrs. Whatsit faltered. I didn't mean ever to let you know. But, oh, my dears, I did so love being a star!</i></p>
<br><hr><br><p>The home of Helen and Michael (Mike, he insisted to be called) was humble to say the least — furnished with only the bare necessities, the most extravagant item of decor the abode contained was a tattered mahogany rug lining the floor, the richness of the colour long faded from use. There was a sofa, as well, one that must have been there for years; it faced a tall bookshelf which leaned against the wall, as if making up for the lack of windows. I surveyed the scene of indigence before me with a pang of pity, noting the musty wooden walls — the paint having peeled to a degree where there were only specks left — and the lone table in the corner surrounded by barren chairs that seemed as if they would break the moment one sat upon them.</p>
<p>Despite its state of lacking, however, there was something — the way Helen darted about, humming and preparing dinner; the way the immaculate floor had evidently been swept with much care; the way Michael tossed his jacket upon the sofa and stretched out with a sigh of contentment — that still gave this place a welcoming aura. I tread carefully, unsure as yet how the small room could possibly accommodate my size, not wanting to disturb this homely setting with my clumsiness.</p>
<p>They referred to me as <i>Savior</i> and <i>Great One</i>, and when they requested me to make myself at home, I begged them to grant me another name, one that did not weigh on my back with dread. They were silent for a second as they thought, and at this moment, a child burst into the room, his youthful energy only heightened by whatever emotion crossed his face when he spotted me. (Alarm? Confusion? Joy and excitement, as Helen had shown earlier? I was not sure; perhaps it was an amalgam of all of those.)</p>
<p><i>Is it true, Mama?</i> he whispered as his eyes shone; my sense of hearing having been heightened, I had to pretend not to hear and instead occupy myself by staring at the rusted titles on the bookshelf beside me. <i>Anna Karenina. The Old Man and The Sea. The Great Gatsby. Robinson Crusoe.</i> and so on — a respectable collection, to be sure; Michael and Helen must have been avid readers in their lifetime. I angled my ears slightly to catch the child's next words. <i>Our Savior has come!</i></p>
<p><i>Yes, it's true.</i></p>
<p><i>Per'aps,</i> Mike said — he spoke with a carrying voice, and I perked up in his direction — <i>per'aps you can christen 'im, son. Our Saver's requested a name, but me an' your mama, we ain't got much imagination.</i> He winked at the child, then smiled at me conspiratorially; I had little choice but to return his smile, as the solicitous nature of these charming people had already taken root in my heart.</p><p>
</p><p><i>No way!</i> The child's eyes lit up as they would at Christmastime, and he scampered to my side, only to balk at the last second and stare at me wide-eyed from a distance. <i>You're so beautiful...</i> he whispered in awe, his gaze raking over my scales. A ripple of pride washed down my back, and I blinked at him, knowing what he really desired.</p>
<p><i>You're free to touch me, if you'd like,</i> I murmured to him, soft enough to escape the ears of the watching parents. He nodded, pursing his lips tightly, and slowly reached forward to stroke my scales, ever-so-gently, a gossamer touch. Helen made a noise of alarm, but was quickly hushed by Michael, who must have seen in my eyes the inexplicable affection I felt toward this child. <i>What is your name?</i></p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>In our world, said Eustace, a star is a huge ball of flaming gas.</i>
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Even in your world, my son, that is not what a star is, but only what it is made of. </i></p>
<br><hr><br><p><i>I'm Kayden,</i> chirped the boy, <i>and I'm nine and my favourite colour is purple. What's your — oh, wait, I'm supposed to make one for you.</i></p>
<p>I was silent as he pondered, his little eyebrows furrowed in concentration. Then: <i>What do you think about Ryeus?</i></p>
<p><i>Ryeus.</i> The name rolled easily off my tongue, and I felt an unexpected spark of pride at the prospect of being the bearer of such a regal, yet simple, name. <i>I believe that will do just fine.</i></p>
<p>Kayden beamed, showing off the gap between his two upper front teeth. <i>It means Star here in Stormdale. Or Morning. Morning Star. Whichever.</i></p>
<p>I nodded. <i>It is fitting,</i> I murmured quietly, and with the words came a faint pull of nostalgia, a hint of the pain I had pushed aside long ago. I was distracted by the child; he was running his fingers lightly over my scales again, seemingly captivated by the lambent reflection of the dim bulb that illuminated the room. An idea struck me, and I slowly craned my neck to reach my right flank, where Kayden was and where I knew the scales were plentiful. Delicately, I grasped one with my sharpened teeth, and pulled it out with a swift jerk of my head.</p>
<p>Kayden gasped, but I quickly allayed his consternation by dropping the scale neatly before his feet. <i>I would very much like for you to keep this,</i> I said. <i>And I will tell you a secret: this scale, as well as my entire being, is created from starstuffs — the strongest material in existence. I grant this piece to you, now, so that you as well may be strong: have faith in the face of asperity, and remember me when you have lost your way. Remember that the stars will always be there to guide you.</i></p>
<p>He grabbed the scale, held onto it so tightly that the whites of his knuckles showed, and stared at me in grave silence. We understood each other better, perhaps, than did the adults and I: for example, I knew that for some gifts, gratitude could never be expressed well enough; and he knew that for this next undertaking, I would need the strength of the stars more than he did.</p>
<p><i>How will you save us?</i></p>
<p><i>I do not know.</i></p>

<h1>IV. VICTORY</h1>
<p>Helen prepared a great dinner that night; a feast, really, by their humble standards. The meal began with a roll of bread and butter, a condiment that was scarce around these parts. There were side dishes of sweet potatoes and corn, salted to perfection. The main course was fish, of course — two large salmon, one fried and the other roasted and sprinkled with lemon sauce, salt, and a few rare, precious pinches of spices. I felt almost humiliated by my beneficiaries, barely getting by themselves, who had spared no resource in order to make my visit here the most pleasant possible.</p>
<p>I ate my fill, and though they encouraged me to take more, I refused, requesting that they save the rest for themselves. Helen reluctantly agreed, and asked Kayden to put aside the dishes. I rested my head between my forelegs, blinking slowly and taking in the scene before me: a warm home, basked in love and, though lacking materially, wanting for nothing. It was not something I had been able to partake in before, and my heart was filled with gratitude for the gift this family had not known they were giving me.</p>
<p><i>It's time,</i> Helen said eventually. Her lips were pressed into a tight, thin line. <i>I'll bring you to the dock.</i> She glanced sideways at Michael and Kayden, and her message was clear: they would not be coming with us.</p>
<p>I got to my feet, my contentment tinged with foreboding at what was to come. I dipped my head to the two sitting solemnly at the table. <i>Thank you for allowing me into your abode, and for sharing your food and drink with me. You were very good hosts, and I am grateful.</i> I looked at Kayden, then, and nodded at the scale he was still clinging so tightly to. <i>Remember what I told you, Kayden, and do not fear.</i> He nodded vigorously in response, though said nothing, his youthful brown eyes wide.</p>
<p>Helen pushed open the door, and I followed behind her. As the frigid evening air replaced the warmth of the cozy cottage, I began to feel a weight sinking in my chest. We spoke little on the short walk there, and I appreciated Helen's silence; perhaps there was little she could have said, but there was little I wanted to know.</p>
<p>We halted just before the dock where I had landed earlier that day. My guide looked up to the sky, a grim expr ssion on her face, and I followed her gaze. Dark grey clouds swirled slowly; not the usual crepuscular wispy tendrils, but a thick, austere blanket that seemed to serve as a portent of death. An ominous, trenchant aura hung about the area — similar to that which I had encountered this afternoon, only tenfold greater. My sandpaper throat throbbed as I swallowed hard.</p>
<p><i>This is where I leave you.</i> Helen's voice took me by surprise; distracted by the scene above us and by what I was about to face, I had momentarily forgotten her presence. I tore my gaze from the sky to meet her light brown eyes, studying her carefully. She may have very well been the last human I was to ever meet. Her hair had been taken down from its bun before, and now fell freely, framing her face with mousy grey wisps. She wore an dark cotton cardigan, which she clutched tightly against her bosom in order to better protect from the wintry sea breeze. Age and poverty had brought tired creases to her eyes, and they deepened as she smiled kindly at me, though concern was apparent throughout her demeanor. </p>
<p><i>Have faith, Ryeus. You were brought to us for a reason.</i></p>
<p><i>Thank you, Helen. I will not forget your generosity.</i> My words were genuine, and she must have sensed so, for her smile widened.</p>
<p><i>Farewell, Savior.</i> She wavered for a brief moment, then left, walking at a brisk pace. Wishing to defer our parting and my subsequent task, I watched until her silhouette had faded into the approaching dusk.</p>
<br><hr><br><p align="center"><i>Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
<br>Never let it fade away</i></p>
<br><hr><br><p>Dusk that night was as I had never seen before — another omen. I watched as a deep shade of indigo crept in to cover the sky from my right, like splashes of dark watercolour upon a pale canvas. There was no lavender, there was no pink; there was only a swarthy purple-black, slowly but surely unfurling to cover the horizon.</p>
<p>The indigo was now blossoming from my left as well, washing in to coalesce with the other stream of purple-blue. It might have been a beautiful sight, if all of my senses had not been screaming of an inimical presence in my midst. The grey began to swirl, spiraling in arbitrary directions, growing all the while. I shifted my position, hoping to obtain a better look. As I did so, I happened to glance downwards and realized, with a start, that the indigo stretching across the sky matched the shade of my scales. Though this struck me as odd, I failed to realize the import of this at the moment.</p>
<p>I continued to watch as the darkness bloomed above me, and when there remained only a sliver of the former pale sky, I strode to the edge of the dock and prayed for intrepidity.</p>
<p><i>My name,</i> I called, addressing the grey mass above me, <i>is Ryeus Lumen.</i> Morning Star, just as Kayden had said. It occurred to me that the night had just begun. I shook my head and continued, my words audacious but my voice almost tremulous. <i>I have been sent to rid this village of the evil you have induced.</i> I knew I need not talk very loud, for whatever being this was, there was no question that it would've been powerful enough to hear me from some distance. The question, now, was whether or not it was willing to answer my call.</p>
<p><i>Come down, whatever you are, and show yourself.</i></p>
<p>I was distantly aware of my heart pulsing, the clamourous pounding in my ears reminding me that in this form, I was very much mortal. I did not know what I was up against, nor did I know my own strengths of weaknesses; I only knew that my trepidation meant nothing, for this was what I had been sent to do — this was, to call upon a platitude, my destiny. (The irony of the situation was that once, I was a part of fate, a part of those which decided the destinies of others. It made me wonder who had decided mine.)</p>
<p>I waited for what seemed eons, though for my former self time was a meaningless concept. I waited, ignoring the incessant throbbing in my ears and the dryness of my throat, until slowly, a small dark orb — the same indigo as that of the sky and of my scales — detached itself from the grey haze and began to float downwards.</p>
<p>I felt several things at once: revulsion, curiosity, loathing, and — most terrifying of all — I felt a pang of recognition.</p>
<p>I <i>knew</i> this orb.</p>
<p>It was my kin.</p>
<p><i>You are a star as well.</i> I had not meant to speak; the words were but a breath, but I knew by the metallic laughter floating through my mind that the darkness had heard.</p>
<p><i>I was.</i> Though my ears heard nothing, the words rang clear in my mind with an almost vociferous intensity. <i>I was, yes, but no longer; now, I am more.</i></p>
<p><i>How can you be more?</i> I cried; with its words, all intention of keeping my thoughts tacit had vanished. <i>We were the kings of the universe. How could you possibly be more?</i> Again, the trenchant pain of remembering, of clinging onto the last vestiges of my former blaze of glory. I gasped to alleviate the pain, but the air was tainted with inexplicable malice, causing my chest to throb more violently.</p>
<p><i>I was once like you,</i> the darkness told me, and I detected a certain undertone — pity? I shuddered in abhorrence. <i>But Ryeus, you must realize. The others are frightened; they are afraid of their full potential. They are too careful for their own good.</i></p>
<p>I opened my mouth to retort a reply, but the darkness continued, more insistent:</p>
<p><i>The humans have forgotten us, Ryeus. They have forgotten the constellations, the reading of the skies; astronomers are long dead and forgotten. They do not deserve to live. We are far more powerful than they. For heaven's sake, we can harness the power of the stars!</i></p>
<p><i>This is not our responsibility,</i> I hissed — the darkness was wrong, it had to be wrong, it must be wrong. I remembered Michael and his geniality; Helen and her altruism; Kayden and his youthful reverence; they gave me strength. <i>There is a reason stars are made with an expiration date.</i></p>
<p>Again, the metallic laugh I so despised. <i>You cannot fight me, Ryeus. I have made it past the date; there must have been a reason, something I was meant to do, some purpose for me to continue living...</i></p>
<p><i>That may be true,</i> I replied quietly, <i>but this... this is not the reason.</i></p>
<p><i>How do you know?</i> The words were laced with gentle pity, and the patronizing tone awoke within me a blaze of anger: anger at its blasphemous words, anger for the sake of the humans who had touched my soul in just a few short hours and whom it was calling worthless, and although perhaps unfair to this particular fallen star, anger at my previous life lost.</p>
<p>I curled my lips back in contempt, baring my teeth. <i>Because I, too, have made it past the date. And I have been sent to stop you.</i></p>
<p>It is difficult to pinpoint what happened afterwards — it seemed that I launched myself into the air and, instantaneously, the dark orb transformed into a form much like that of myself. The same wingspan, the same colour scheme, the same pointed claws... In fact, we might have been twins, save that its eyes were a solid black.</p>
<p>We circled each other in the air warily; judging from our respective forms, it would be an even battle, with no clear winner. Perhaps it had the upper hand, for we were under its skies and grey clouds — however, I had no intention of fighting here.</p>
<p><i>I had hoped it wouldn't come to this.</i> The words were a sigh, echoing in my mind. <i>I do not wish to fight you, brother.</i></p>
<p>I growled, clenching my claws. <i>I am not your brother,</i> I hissed through gritted teeth, <i>and I never will be.</i></p>
<p><i>If you wish.</i></p>
<p>It launched itself at me, and I turned tail and fled, thanking the skies that I had trained myself to go full speed in flight. Evidently, my enemy had not expected me to run, for it wavered for a couple seconds before following suit. Thus began a chase across the sea. Grimly, I tucked my legs tightly under my belly and poured on the speed, silently praying for my wings to hold. I hoped to lead it to the island where I had spent my first weeks as a mortal, a place where we could battle without chance of harming a human. My mission would have been null had I compromised the safety of the village I was trying to save.</p>
<p>I didn't make it to the island. I felt it behind me, and only had time to duck under and narrowly avoid its lashing claws. I retaliated by snapping at its tail, and we began to fight mid-sea, with claws and white fire and streams of invective. I used my anger, my desperation, my pain — but try as I might, we were still evenly matched, and I was already out of breath from the chase.</p>
<p><i>Heavens, help me!</i> I begged as I ducked another slash, aimed for my exposed stomach; its tail whipped my face, then, and I felt a cut forming under my eye. <i>You sent me here, you must see me through this!</i> I was weakening. <i>Please... I cannot fail now...</i> My wingbeats were slower, less powerful; my enemy must have sensed this, for it began a fresh barrage of attacks, the worst of which I would soon no longer have the energy to fend off.</p>
<p><i>I warned you, Ryeus,</i> — another sigh in my head, another slice and dodge — <i>you cannot defeat me...</i></p>
<p>The heavens were silent, but I forced myself to battle despair. There had to be another way. Some means of stopping this evil from effacing the human world...</p>
<p>The realization came, a shooting star in the dark of night, and I marveled at how long it had taken me. I was not meant to live. Once more I was give up my life, once more I was to sacrifice myself for the hope of something better to take my place — and that of the malevolence I was to take with me...</p>
<p>I stopped fighting.</p>
<p>The evil jibed at me, viciously raking my scales to expose a stripe of my left flank — <i>have you relented already?</i> — but when I stared resolutely at its coal eyes and refused to move, it ceased battling as well.</p>
<p>Evil had honour, after all.</p>
<p><i>Ryeus.</i> Its voice was cautious, but warm. <i>My brother. I knew you would comprehend my objective eventually.</i></p>
<p>I studied its face, just as I had studied that of dear Helen's not so long ago, and marveled at the dissimilarities. Whereas I had looked upon her features with endearment, with this incubus there was only a void of emotion tainted with antipathy. I would feel no regret liberating the beauty of this world from the wretched menace in front of me; I only wished I had had more opportunity to indulge in quotidian pleasures during my sojourn here.</p>
<p><i>This is no capitulation,</i> I said. <i>And you are not my brother.</i></p>
<p>It is difficult to explain exactly what took place thereafter, for the reason that I am not certain myself; I was guided by intuition, and inexplicably understood that there were some attributes of a star I still possessed. For example, the ability to instantaneously self-destruct — to move up one's expiration date.</p>
<p>I saw understanding flicker in its eyes, and the voice spoke with poorly hidden trepidation. <i>What you plan to perform will be a futile effort; you are no longer a star.</i></p>
<p><i>No,</i> I replied; <i>I am mortal, as you are.</i></p>
<p>A slow pressure began to build inside my chest, gaining heat, growing into a flame, then slowly swelling into a stream of white fire, begging to be freed, to consume its targets...</p>
<p>The blistering blaze burst out of my mouth, enfolding the fallen star. The sound it made was a howl so trenchant that it seared itself into my soul and my memories forever. This was the last thing I perceived from this world before it was devoured by an ivory inferno.</p>
<p>Finally at ease, I closed my eyes and welcomed my subsequent oblivion; if I strained, I could see in the faint distance a multitude of scintillating stars...</p>

<h1>V. REBIRTH</h1>
<p>Even as I dreamt, their brilliance shattered my vision into a million twinkling lights.</p>
<p>The stars; they were the last thing I saw, and the first thing I saw, and everything in between. There was no escape. But I wanted none, for in the stars I saw hope, and glory, and everything I'd wanted, everything I ever would want.</p>
<p>They felt so cold, and far away.</p>
<p>I clung to them as to the beacon of a lighthouse. I was lost at sea, unable to escape the waves of terror and confusion; the sense of loss I felt, the sense of <i>missing.</i> Who was I? Why was I here? Why could I not leave?</p>
<p>Where was 'here'?</p>
<p>I was lost...</p>
<br><br><p>And then I shone. I shone with the brilliance of my memories, and it was everything — <i>everything</i> — I had recalled it would be...</p>
<p>Here was home.</p>
<br><br><p>I had one last task: the boy, Kayden. I approached him in his slumber, easing my way into his dreams. They were fitful, I found, for one so young — but they were of an evil that had now passed, to my gratification.</p>
<p><i>Ryeus,</i> he said, recognizing me immediately; I bowed my head to him.</p>
<p><i>Are we safe? Is it gone?</i></p>
<p>I smiled, and he beamed a smile that almost put me to shame.</p>
<p><i>You must keep the village — Stormdale — safe now, Kayden,</i> I told him gently. <i>I am entrusting its care to you.</i> He gaped at me, wide-eyed, but I knew this charge would be held responsibly by this youthful, earnest soul. <i>Do not fear. You know what to do already.</i> I nodded to the starstuff shaped as a dragon scale, hung on a piece of dark thread around his neck.</p>
<p><i>But where are you going now, Ryeus? Will you not come back?</i></p>
<p><i>I am returning to where I belong... but I will be with you always.</i></p>
<p>The dream began to fade. The last thing I saw was his small hand reaching up to grasp the scale tightly...</p>

<h1>EPILOGUE</h1>
<p>The cottage was furnished with only the bare necessities; the most extravagant item of decor the abode contained was a tattered mahogany rug lining the floor, the richness of the colour long faded from use. There was a sofa, as well, one that must have been there for years; it faced a small television that flickered lazily now, showing some reality show or other, the bright smiles of kids and their respective parents alternating in rapid flashes on the screen.</p>
<p>Two small girls played nearby. One of them, a brunette with mischievous dark eyes, grabbed a doll from her fair-haired sister and held it high above her head. The other girl began to scream, her bright blue eyes brimming with angry tears. <i>Heleeeeenaaaaa! Give it back give it back give it back!</i></p>
<p><i>Shush that ruckus, Mia.</i> The blonde girl ceased screaming at the sound of her mother's voice and resorted to glaring maliciously at her sister, her small hands trying in vain to reach the doll. <i>And Helena, give that doll back to your sister.</i> She reluctantly complied, sticking her tongue out at Mia who turned her back as soon as she had regained possession of the doll.</p>
<p>The mother, a woman of roughly thirty who went by the name of Anna, had a face that portrayed a sagacity beyond her years. Her hair fell in pretty brown ringlets down her back, and giving her a youthful prettiness despite the plain lavender dress she wore. She was tall, and presented a rather imposing figure as she frowned sternly down at her daughters even while cradling a third child — a boy — in her arms. <i><b>Behave,</b> you two.</i></p>
<p>There was a gentle tapping at the door. Shooting a look at the two girls — a silent warning to not cause any more trouble — Anna hurried to the entrance, still holding the baby. Helena began to side-eye the doll in her mother's absence, but was soon distracted by Anna's cry of delight. The two girls exchanged a curious look, wondering if they should go inspect the new arrival.</p>
<p>It turns out that there was no need, for Anna soon walked back into the room, the newcomer in tow. It was an elderly man, one whom the girls evidently recognized, as they both jumped to their feet to embrace him with cries of <i>Grandpa! Grandpa!</i> His movements were lethargic, but the corners of his eyes crinkled in a yet lively happiness at the sight of his grandchildren.</p>
<p>The baby began crying, then, and Anna crooned softly to him, petting his hair gently in an effort to appease him. <i>Shh, Kayden, it's alright, shhh, it's only Grandpa... You would think that one would be more merry upon meeting their namesake,</i> she chuckled, directing this last comment at her father. He only smiled — the baby's cries were music to his ears — and gradually made his way over to the sofa, where he lowered himself with a small sigh.</p>
<p><i>I'm getting too old for this world, Anna.</i> His tone was light, but she frowned.</p>
<p><i>Don't say that, Papa.</i></p>
<p><i>It's true. But do not fear for me; there are greater things than this life, and I look forward to the journey ahead.</i></p>
<p>She said nothing in response, but walked over to join her father. Little Kayden was still whimpering, but when his grandfather took him into his arms, he fell silent, enraptured by the shiny object that dangled from the elder's throat.</p>
<p><i>Ah, yes. This I must pass on.</i></p>
<p><i>What is it, Papa?</i> Anna's curiosity piqued; she'd noticed that her father rarely took off the pendant, though she never thought to question why exactly that was.</p>
<p><i>This is a gift,</i> her father replied, <i>that I now pass on to little Kayden. But for now, Anna, you must take care of it, until he is old enough — it will not be long.</i></p>
<p>She swallowed, unsure of what exactly he was asking of her. <i>How will I be sure? That he is ready, I mean.</i></p>
<p><i>Oh, he will understand its significance in time; little boys usually do. Just remind him. Remind him to look at the stars, to remember their majesty and power... and remind him, above all, that the human soul is made of the essence of starstuff — strength, and righteousness, and the willingness to fight for what is good.</i></p>
