<h1>Warrior's Heart</h1>
<p>I stand proud above the mountains
<br>I pray silently below the seas
<br>I beckon the world to follow my lead
<br>My will touch as far as I can reach
</p>
<p>My emotions are a masquerade of deception
<br>My bones will never be battered nor broken
<br>Fear is meaningless if I open my eyes
<br>I see through every sinful, bitter lie
</p>
<p>The shadows have become my only friend
<br>Silence shall be my bliss till the very end
<br>Prepared to throw all my life on the line
<br>I will fight until the end of time.

<h2>Ragdoll</h2>
<p>I watched in horror as they loomed over me like menacing shadows. Every single one of them, bigger than I was, stronger than I was. The biggest one was covered in muscles and scars, and the way his stubble looked like spikes made him seem that much more fearsome. I was curled up into a ball, backed into a corner as they inched closer, a smirk playing at their lips.
</p>
<p>One of them reached out, grabbing for my hair. I was lifted into the air like a ragdoll, held like a dishrag. I kicked my legs and clawed at the person's iron grip to no avail. He simply laughed at my efforts and tossed me across the warehouse as if I weighed nothing.
</p>
<p>I hit the dirty, concrete floor with a thud and I rolled backwards until my back hit another wall. My arm throbbed and warm blood trickled down my forehead. A soft groan escaped my lips as I tried to stand.
</p>
<p>The man who threw me looked down at me and spat at the ground next to him. "You useless little piece of trash," he boomed as he lifted me again, by the collar and bringing one fist up to my face, "I'll teach you to mess with the Lords!" With that last word, he landed a punch right across my face. Blood oozed out from my teeth as I ran my tongue over each of them, counting the ones that fell out.
</p>
<p>One of his goons gave a chant, and the others joined in. It was difficult to hear what they were saying through all the fog in my brain and the ringing in my ears. The man still held me by my shirt, and I dangled uselessly at his mercy.
</p>
<p>I saw white teeth shine through his dubious smile as he loosened his grip and I slowly tumbled to the ground.
</p>
<p>I laid completely unmoving as I heard a few low grumbles among the goons and their footsteps fading away. I shivered in my rags and rubbed my arms with my dirt-coated fingers. I let out a sniffle and cold tears began pouring out of my eyes.
</p>
<p>It was then that fear overcame my entire being and I felt the despair squeezing at my heart. I started shaking as my brain recalled the images of the way the man grabbed me, the way he ruthlessly knocked out a child's teeth.
</p>
<p>Then, my mind reeled back to before I found out about the Lords. Memories of me dragging bricks with my thin, weak arms, and how the sirs would whip me if I didn't. I remembered the fear of staggering up a creaky, old wooden plank to place the bricks on the castle in construction. My stomach twisted as I thought about how I'd never get more than a meal a day. They mainly consisted of stale bread and a cup of unsanitized water.
</p>
<p>One day, the Lords came and wreaked havoc on our hard work. They overtook the royal army and said that anyone who dared to oppose them were as good as dead.
</p>
<p>I didn't dare raise a finger, but someone started an uproar against them. What was supposed to be a revolution for the slaves became a war, an apocalypse. I was one of the last standing, but now they've beaten me to the ground...

<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Eva. This is my app for Esume the faerie draik.
</p>
<li>I will change his gender, so in this app, Esume will be a girl
</li>
<li>I have no intention on changing her colour/species
</li>
<li>She will never be used as trading fodder. If I ever happen to lose inspiration, I will ask you if you'd like her back or adopt her out to a new owner.
</li>
<li>I was in no way forced to make this application
