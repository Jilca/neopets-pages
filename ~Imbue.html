<h1>the Empathy Witch</h1>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/a1jGlCT.png" title="Drawn with love by Mary!" style="float: right; margin-right: 5px; width: 170px;"><b>Name:</b> Bue
<br><b>Alias:</b> the Empathy Witch (Imbuer)
<br><b>Age:</b> Unknown
<br><b>Birthday:</b> 30th October
<br><b>Zodiac sign:</b> Scorpio
<br><b>Height:</b> 100 cms
<br><b>Weight:</b> Tsk, don't you know it is rude to ask a lady her weight?
<p><b>Personality:</b>
<br>♠<i>Transient;</i> I can never stay in one place for an extended period of time. I travel, I move. Not in search for acceptance or answers, because I have made peace with the fact that there may never be any. Agitation comes with comfort; my powers are ever-growing and never-guarded.
<br>♦<i>Self-willed;</i> combating my internal thoughts has become a downtime of mine. Every word, every move I make comes as a product of raw willpower
<br>♣<i>Unyielding;</i> an advantage of living as the most introverted person I know is that I can make my own decisions without discretion. I never have the inclination to describe my actions and graph all the thoughts that tower down in a domino-like motion.
<br>♥<i>Manipulative;</i> manipulation strings along power...a very strange power. I am perceived to be quite the compeller.
</p><center><p><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/cshadwraith.gif" style="border-radius: 99em;"></p><br><b>Death</b> the <b>Captive Shadow Wraith</b></center>
<p>This spirited and quick-witted creature was born from the corruption that infested Bue's mind. It harvests the madness and sadness not transferred to songs and plagues it upon others.
</p><p>The trickster has always been up to mischief, hissing barely-audible riddles and half the time telling tales that would elongate his nose.
</p><p>He often accompanies her on dark nights when her emotions are frenzied and intuition is highly questionable. Bue makes an effort to eclipse herself from society on these rare nights, but Death always has a way of tracking her down. He promises her peace and a cease of the madness encroaching her mind. His simple instructions require a song of demise, one which will eradicate the souls of all who hear it and mutate them into Captive Shadow Wraiths.
</p><p>For years, Bue has tried to abandon the creature, for all it has wrought was despair. However, like her curses, she would have to take Death with her to the grave.

<h1>My cries gradually <i>crescendo</i></h1>
<br><i>in first-person perspective of bue</i>
<p>I was the first of triplets birthed into our family. We lived in a small house in an unnamed, uncivilized town. My younger sisters, Elle and Wanda, were my only friends and the three of us were inseparable.
</p><p>Our living condition was never adequate for a family of five; the rooms always full and plates near empty. Having three children set a heavy strain on our parents' financial situation but we were raised with more love than we deserved. Mother would wake us every morning reminding us how loved we were, cooing, "You are all 'Elle-gant', 'Wanda-ful', and 'Bue-tiful'."
</p><p>At a very young age, I discovered my passion for music and played the piano like a prodigy. I hadn't the education to compose words, so I sang tunes imbued with emotions. As if my melodies were magic, those who listened were always overcome with emotion and empathy.
</p><p>I was viewed as the Godsend of my family; parents quick to spend their life's savings to enroll me in a business school to study law. Their thoughts, which seemed reasonable at the time were: <i>If Bue could bring people to tears with sympathy, there isn't any possibility she can lose a court case!</i> They dashed away my sisters' aspirations of becoming a jeweler and an accountant.
</p><p>Having the strength to wake up every day became scarce almost immediately. I scra.ped by school with barely-passing grades due to my inability to convert my thoughts into sounds or words. My piano was sold to sustain the tuition, and I often had to stay awake long night after night to catch up with other students. My sisters and I grew distant and depressed.
</p><center><p><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/gif_forms_stack.gif" style="border-radius: 99em;"></p>
<p>I had little belief I could become a businesswoman from the beginning, but hope was something my family hadn't experienced in a long time. I hung onto it for dear life, thinking I could lift the curse of our never-ending poverty.
</p><p>I stood on the knife's edge—literally—at some point when everything I had worked for crumbled. My two beloved sisters caved in the same week Death appeared for the first time. Elle's disappearance and Wanda's suicide drove me dangerously close to the edge. The little wraith claimed he could help; teach me how to transfer my emotions to elegies, and any that remained, he would take away.
</p><p>It wasn't an offer I held any position in to refuse. If it weren't for him, I wasn't sure if I'd be sane...or <i>alive</i>. He stayed true to his word, leaving the house ever so often to complete "errands", but remained by my side. I eventually caught up in grades, held a short job to sustain us, and purchased a new piano.
</p><p>Shortly after as what I perceived to be the backlash of losing children, my parents seemingly aged a decade. They spoke less, ate less, and smiled scarcely. I was afraid to speak to them at times because they would mistake me for another of my sisters. They would mutter in awe as if I were an apparition of them, and occasionally forget they were even dead. Most times, I heard muffled arguing or crying at night, but hadn't felt any obligation to comfort them. I grew numb inside, only the sporadic ghost of an emotion bouncing the walls of my hollow heart. It was like the drop of a needle in an empty room, its sound reverberating the vacant mass.
</p><p>It wasn't until both of my parents had passed that reality sunk in like an anchor dropping to my stomach. The house was deathly silent for four days before I noticed. Swamped in my studies, operating on autopilot, I also hadn't noticed Death's trips extending vastly. He would vanish for most nights, and although curious, I was one to mind my own business.
</p><p>However, with a blade, bleach, and blood splattered at my feet, I lost it. I shrieked at the top of my lungs, trying to drink the white fluid without the strength the swallow. Then, doused Death with it, thinking he'd vaporize and shrivel into nothing.
</p><p>I slashed my wrists to no drunken satisfaction because I was transferring it all away; my cries were melodic, and they <b>crescendoed</b>. "Why? Tell me <i>why</i>!"
</p><p>He looked me in the eye, grasping my face in his wraithy hands. "You're very special. Everything you sing and play will lull those who listen into submission to your feelings and thoughts. However, that means that you bear the burden of too many overpowering emotions. Every time I leave, I take your sadness and give it to other people; nothing simply <i>disappears</i>, my dear.
</p><p>But to answer you why; well, that is like explaining your entire existence and how every part of you came to be. Why are you you, and why am I me? That's a foolish thing to ask, is it not?"
</p><p>I swallowed his words like a dry pill. It wasn't a painful process, but it was slow, uncomfortable, and wouldn't fully sink in until it reached my stomach. "What do you suggest I do now, then?" I muttered, barely audible. "My family is dead, I've nothing to work for...Hell, I'm talking to a ghost."
</p><p>Death tilted his head. "Everyone will eventually discover your parents, then you, then your powers. They'll think you murdered them in cold blood and most likely doom you with punishment."
</p><p>Rage boiled me, and I lashed out in unearthly screams. "You! This is all your fault! I didn't murder anybody! I'm not going to jail to compensate for what you did!" I paused, trailing off into hiccups and tears. "Haven't I suffered enough already?"
</p><p>Unfazed, he took my hand and started off. "Someone may have heard you. We are leaving. Now."

<h1>Beautiful tunes come with dangerous tempers</h1>
<h2>Chapter One</h2>
<br><i>in first person perspective of bue</i>
<p>My hands glided across the length of the smooth black-and-white keys, filling the hall with great tunes. Long, slim fingers struck notes in quick succession, exercising their muscle memory. By now, I could repeat the most complex of repertoires, eyes closed and mind often drifting into subconscious oblivion. My body was accustomed to operating on autopilot; feet holding down the pedal and sensually slurring the tune, shoulders swaying with the song, lips molding a melody.
<br></p><center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/mus_grand_piano.gif" style="border-radius: 99em;"></center>
<p>I sang an elegy; a beautiful piece of dreams and love undertoned with despair and lament. Song by song, the concert elapsed effortlessly and I concluded my performance with the same line as always: <i>...And I'd like to imbue my heart with you.</i>
</p><p>The audience rose like a rolling wave, teary-eyed and applauding loudly. I stood mechanically and took a swift bow. The end of my concerts always passed in a daze, all my pent-up anxiety and confusion taking their toll in the form of a mental breakdown. My brain reeled through every note I missed and which words were sung a pinch too high. I wondered why my music could afflict the audience with such ecstatic sorrow. I questioned when and how these...<i>abilities</i> were born into me. Was I putting them to good use? Is someone out there more deserving of them? Will they one day vanish?
</p><p>Who gave them to me? Was I meant to become someone? Or simply insane? What does insanity feel like? Am I already—?
</p><p>From the edge of my vision I saw Death's jet-black eyes manifest from the shadows, the remainder of him slowly emerging. He saw the resistance in my expr<i></i>ession and relaxed a fraction. Perching himself beside me and laying a ghastly claw on my leg, I was instantly jerked from my reverie.
</p><p><b>No.</b> This will not be one of those nights.
</p><p>My eyes darted around and drank in the surroundings. The walls were slick from a fresh coat of bleach-white paint. The room used to be a dark, rich mahogany, but I insisted it be replaced. It had been weeks and the original colour was still visible. My walls were a light, fleshy hue and it looked like the inside of a giant's belly. Furniture was scarce to be of less trouble for the painters, and things to flip over didn't bode well with my increasing relapses of tantrums.
</p><p>."The audience was yet again enraptured by your...<i>performance</i>," Death enunciated the last word like a private joke. "Three years and I am still amazed by how easily manipulated these creatures are every single time."
</p><p>."I'm not going this for your amusem<i></i>ent," I assured, though it was me who needed reassurance.
</p><p>."Duly noted," he sighed. "Three years and still every day you berate me of how little value I am to you. It hurts my poor heart."
</p><p>I cast him a sideways glance, unconvinced, digging through the drawers of my vanity. Scrap music sheets, hand cream, pens. Sweat beaded on my face as confusion and worry settled in.
</p><p>."You look awfully pale. Have you taken your pills?" Death smiled inquisitively, the corners of his lips hinting mischievousness.
</p><p>The door creaked open after a few knocks I hadn't heard and the wraith immediately eased into a shadow. My assistant entered and the tension in the air rose tenfold. She peered about nervously, only halfway through the door, as if waiting for instruction.
</p><p>."You can put my dinner on the vanity, thank you," I spoke evenly.
</p><p></p><center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/alf_veggie_grill_plate.gif" style="border-radius: 99em;"></center>
<p>She complied wordlessly, and I turned to Death, who snickered silently at her obedience. With that I knew he still viewed me as the confused, corrupted child he found sprawled in a puddle of tears on the floor. I was a child who controlled an unfathomable power, and grown adults were practically groveling at it.
</p><p>With her departure, I heard mutterings of how what a shame it was that the best composer of my age was borderline insane. She glanced back, as if realizing she spoke too loudly, but turned again at my oblivious expre.ssion.
</p><p>."Death," I growled, "where did you put my pills?"
</p><p>He emerged from the shadow once again and shot me what seemed to be a demented smirk. "I've no idea what you mean."
</p><p>I stood, pacing. Exercise and movement always smoothed my nerves. "You know I need those to control my temper."
</p><p>."They are on the top shelf behind the toilet rolls in the janitor's closet in the opposite wing," he mumbled, as if rushed.
</p><p>I dashed out the room without hesitation, pushing past fans and admirers who tried to sneak backstage to send me roses. The wraith's hurried tone somehow set something off internally, and I had the most brooding pang in my stomach. It was the same feeling I had the night of my parents' passing, and ever since then, it had always marked a death of some sort.
</p><p>The medicine was indeed where it was said to be; I'd never been lied to, but somehow I always had fresh doubt when talking to my companion.
</p><p>Just then, gunshots shook the building and screams filled the halls. The prospect of danger always drew me to the source, and I pushed past crowds of people who were no longer interested in the child prophecy of the twenty-first century, and shoved me left and right like any ordinary human.
</p><p>It took me doubly as long to make it back to my dressing room, to find police stationed at every corner within a 5-metre proximity. I hid behind a knocked-over table.
</p><p>One officer, with her back to me, held up a portrait and another gestured to it, speaking in a low voice, "...roughly 100 centimetres tall and jet-black hair. Her eyes are always red, and her skin is pale-white. Some people call her <i>The Imbuer</i>."
</p><p>Death manifested at my side and leaned casually on my thigh. "You've stirred trouble again, my dear."
</p><p>."I didn't ki<i></i>ll anybody this time," I protested, barely able to produce words. "I'm sure of it!"
</p><p>."If you don't do something, they'll catch you regardless," he warned, placing a claw on my quivering hand. "And you haven't had your pills yet. Anything you try to sing will be too powerful and will mean their immediate demise."
</p><p>I tried to breathe. Perhaps I could turn myself in and explain the situation slowly and peacefully. There wouldn't be any need for violence! Whatever the reason the police was after me can't be solved with a little classical music once everyone has calmed down.
</p><p>A body fell at my feet, and whatever consolation I built up inside crumbled with my ear-piercing scream. Without turning from the dead man before me, I knew I had attracted unwanted attention. I heard pistols loading and pointed at me, and I shook in dreadful silence, knowing I was the one they wanted, knowing they'd think I murdered a person, waiting to be ended.
